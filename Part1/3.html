<p>On TUESDAY morning a dome of grey sky rose
over the parched city, but the stifling air was
not reHeved by the silvery mist that seemed to
hold a promise of rain, which did not fall.</p>
<p>To Irene Redfield this soft foreboding
fog was another reason for doing nothing
about seeing Clare Kendry that afternoon.</p>
<p>But she did see her.</p>
<p>The telephone. For hours it had rung
like something possessed. Since nine o’clock she
had been hearing its insistent jangle. Awhile
she was resolute, saying firmly each time: “Not
in, Liza, take the message.” And each time the
servant returned with the information: “It’s the
same lady, ma’am; she says she’ll call again.”</p>
<p>But at noon, her nerves frayed and her
conscience smiting her at the reproachful look
on Liza’s ebony face as she withdrew for another denial, Irene weakened.</p>
<p>“Oh, never mind. I’ll answer this time,
Liza.”</p>
<p>‘It’s her again.”</p>
<p>“Hello… . Yes.’’</p>
<p>“It’s Clare, ‘Rene… . Where have
you been? … Can you be here around four?
… What? … But, ‘Rene, you promised!
Just for a little while… . You can if you
want to. … I am so disappointed. I had
counted so on seeing you… . Please be nice
and come. Only for a minute. I’m sure you can
manage it If you try. … I won’t beg you to
stay… . Yes… . I’m going to expect you
… It’s the Morgan… Oh, yes! The
name’s Bellew, Mrs. John Bellew… . About
four, then… . I’ll be so happy to see
you! … Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“Damn!”</p>
<p>Irene hung up the receiver with an emphatic bang, her thoughts immediately filled
with self-reproach. She’d done it again. Allowed Clare Kendry to persuade her into promising to do something for which she had neither
time nor any special desire. What was it about
Clare’s voice that was so appealing, so very
seductive ?
Clare met her in the hall with a kiss.
She said: “You’re good to come, ‘Rene. But,
then, you always were nice to me.” And under
her potent smile a part of Irene’s annoyance
with herself fled. She was even a little glad that
she had come.</p>
<p>Clare led the way, stepping lightly, towards a room whose door was standing partly
open, saying: “There’s a surprise. It’s a real
party. See.”</p>
<p>Entering, Irene found herself in a sitting-room, large and high, at whose windows
hung startling blue draperies which triumphantly dragged attention from the gloomy chocolate-coloured furniture. And Clare was wearing
a thin floating dress of the same shade of blue,
which suited her and the rather difficult room
to perfection.</p>
<p>For a minute Irene thought the room
was empty, but turning her head, she discovered, sunk deep in the cushions of a huge
sofa, a woman staring up at her with such intense concentration that her eyelids were drawn
as though the strain of that upward glance had
paralysed them. At first Irene took her to be
a stranger, but In the next instant she said in an
unsympathetic, almost harsh voice: “And how
are you, Gertrude?”</p>
<p>The woman nodded and forced a smile
to her pouting lips. “I’m all right,” she replied.
“And you’re just the same, Irene. Not changed
a bit.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Irene responded, as she
chose a seat. She was thinking: “Great goodness! Two of them.”</p>
<p>For Gertrude too had married a white
man, though It couldn’t be truthfully said that
she was “passing.” Her husband — what was
his name? — had been In school with her
and had been quite well aware, as had his
family and most of his friends, that she was
a Negro. It hadn’t, Irene knew, seemed to
matter to him then. Did it now, she wondered? Had Fred — Fred Martin, that was
It — had he ever regretted his marriage
because of Gertrude’s race? Had Gertrude ?</p>
<p>Turning  to  Gertrude,  Irene  asked:
“And Fred, how Is he? It’s unmentionable years
since I’ve seen him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s all right,” Gertrude answered briefly.</p>
<p>For a full minute no one spoke. Finally
out of the oppressive little silence Clare’s voice
came pleasantly, conversationally: “We’ll have
tea right away. I know that you can’t stay long,
‘Rene. And I’m so sorry you won’t see Margery. We went up the lake over the week end
to see some of Jack’s people, just out of Milwaukee. Margery wanted to stay with the
children. It seemed a shame not to let her, especially since It’s so hot In town. But I’m expecting Jack any second.”</p>
<p>Irene said briefly: “That’s nice.”</p>
<p>Gertrude remained silent. She was. It
was plain, a little 111 at ease. And her presence
there annoyed Irene, roused in her a defensive
and resentful feeling for which she had at the
moment no explanation. But It did seem to
her odd that the woman that Clare was now
should have Invited the woman that Gertrude  was.  Still,  of  course,  Clare  couldn’t
have known. Twelve years since they had met.</p>
<p>Later, when she examined her feeHng
of annoyance, Irene admitted, a shade reluctantly, that it arose from a feeling of being outnumbered, a sense of aloneness, in her adherence to her own class and kind; not merely in
the great thing of marriage, but in the whole
pattern of her life as well.</p>
<p>Clare spoke again, this time at length.
Her talk was of the change that Chicago presented to her after her long absence in European cities. Yes, she said in reply to some question from Gertrude, she’d been back to
America a time or two, but only as far as New
York and Philadelphia, and once she had spent
a few days in Washington. John Bellew, who,
it appeared, was some sort of international
banking agent, hadn’t particularly wanted her
to come with him on this trip, but as soon as
she had learned that it would probably take him
as far as Chicago, she made up her mind to
come anyway.</p>
<p>“I simply had to. And after I once got
here, I was determined to see someone I knew
and find out what had happened to everybody.
I didn’t quite see how I was going to manage
It, but I meant to. Somehow. I’d just about
decided to take a chance and go out to your
house, ‘Rene, or call up and arrange a meeting, when I ran Into you. What luck!”</p>
<p>Irene agreed that It was luck. “It’s the
first time I’ve been home for five years, and
now I’m about to leave. A week later and I’d
have been gone. And how In the world did you
find Gertrude?”</p>
<p>“In the book. I remembered about
Fred. His father still has the meat market.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” said Irene, who had only
remembered It as Clare had spoken, “on Cottage Grove near — “</p>
<p>Gertrude broke In. “No. It’s moved.
We’re on Maryland Avenue — used to be Jackson— now. Near Sixty-third Street. And the
market’s Fred’s. His name’s the same as his
father’s.”</p>
<p>Gertrude, Irene thought, looked as If
her husband might be a butcher. There was left
of her youthful prettiness, which had been so
much admired In their high-school days, no
trace. She had grown broad, fat almost, and
though there were no lines on her large white
face. Its very smoothness was somehow prematurely ageing. Her black hair was dipt, and
by some unfortunate means all the live curliness
had gone from It. Her over-trimmed Georgette crepe dress was too short and showed an
appalling amount of leg, stout legs In sleazy
stockings of a vivid rose-beige shade. Her
plump hands were newly and not too competently manicured — for the occasion, probably.
And she wasn’t smoking.</p>
<p>Clare said — and Irene fancied that her
husky voice held a slight edge — “Before you
came, Irene, Gertrude was telling me about her
two boys. Twins. Think of It ! Isn’t It too marvellous for words?”</p>
<p>Irene felt a warmness creeping Into her
cheeks. Uncanny, the way Clare could divine
what one was thinking. She was a little put out,
but her manner was entirely easy as she said:
“That Is nice. I’ve two boys myself, Gertrude.
Not twins, though. It seems that Clare’s rather
behind, doesn’t It?”</p>
<p>Gertrude, however, wasn’t sure that
Clare hadn’t the best of It. “She’s got a girl. I
wanted a girl. So did Fred.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a bit unusual?” Irene asked.
“Most men want sons. Egotism, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Well, Fred didn’t.”</p>
<p>The tea-things had been placed on a low
table at Clare’s side. She gave them her attention now, pouring the rich amber fluid from the
tall glass pitcher Into stately slim glasses, which
she handed to her guests, and then offered them
lemon or cream and tiny sandwiches or cakes.</p>
<p>After taking up her own glass she informed them: “No, I have no boys and I don’t
think I’ll ever have any. I’m afraid. I nearly
died of terror the whole nine months before
Margery was born for fear that she might be
dark. Thank goodness, she turned out all right.
But I’ll never risk It again. Never ! The strain
Is simply too — too hellish.”</p>
<p>Gertrude Martin nodded in complete
comprehension.
This time it was Irene who said nothing.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to tell me!” Gertrude
said fervently. ‘’I know what it is all right.
Maybe you don’t think I wasn’t scared to death
too. Fred said I was silly, and so did his mother.
But, of course, they thought it was just a notion I’d gotten into my head and they blamed
it on my condition. They don’t know like we
do, how it might go way back, and turn out
dark no matter what colour the father and
mother are.”</p>
<p>Perspiration stood out on her forehead.
Her narrow eyes rolled first in Clare’s, then in
Irene’s direction. As she talked she waved her
heavy hands about.</p>
<p>“No,” she went on, “no more for me
either. Not even a girl. It’s awful the way it
skips generations and then pops out. Why, he
actually said he didn’t care what colour it
turned out, if I would only stop worrying about
it. But, of course, nobody wants a dark child.”
Her voice was earnest and she took for granted
that her audience was In entire agreement with
her.</p>
<p>Irene, whose head had gone up with a
quick little jerk, now said in a voice of whose
even tones she was proud: “One of my boys
IS dark.”</p>
<p>Gertrude jumped as if she had been
shot at. Her eyes goggled. Her mouth flew
open. She tried to speak, but could not immediately get the words out. Finally she managed
to stammer: “Oh! And your husband, is he — is
he — er — dark, too?”</p>
<p>Irene, who was struggling with a flood
of feelings, resentment, anger, and contempt,
was, however, still able to answer as coolly as
if she had not that sense of not belonging to
and of despising the company in which she
found herself drinking iced tea from tall amber glasses on that hot August afternoon. Her
husband, she informed them quietly, couldn’t
exactly “pass.”</p>
<p>At that reply Clare turned on Irene her
seductive caressing smile and remarked a little
scoffingly: “I do think that coloured people —
we — are too silly about some things. After all,
the thing’s not Important to Irene or hundreds
of others. Not awfully, even to you, Gertrude.
It’s only deserters like me who have to be
afraid of freaks of the nature. As my inestimable dad used to say, ‘Everything must be
paid for.’ Now, please one of you tell me what
ever happened to Claude Jones. You know, the
tall, lanky specimen who used to wear that comical little moustache that the girls used to laugh
at so. Like a thin streak of soot. The moustache, I mean.”</p>
<p>At that Gertrude shrieked with laughter.
“Claude Jones!” and launched into the story of
how he was no longer a Negro or a Christian
but had become a Jew.</p>
<p>“A Jew!” Clare exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yes, a Jew. A black Jew, he calls himself. He won’t eat ham and goes to the synagogue on Saturday. He’s got a beard now as
well as a moustache. You’d die laughing if you
saw him. He’s really too funny for words. Fred
says he’s crazy and I guess he Is. Oh, he’s a
scream all right, a regular scream!” And she
shrieked again.</p>
<p>Clare’s laugh tinkled out. “It certainly
sounds funny enough. Still, it’s his own business.
If he gets along better by turning — “</p>
<p>At that, Irene, who was still hugging
her unhappy don’t-care feeling of rightness,
broke In, saying bitingly: “It evidently doesn’t
occur to either you or Gertrude that he might
possibly be sincere In changing his religion.
Surely everyone doesn’t do everything for
gain.”</p>
<p>Clare Kendry had no need to search for
the full meaning of that utterance. She reddened slightly and retorted seriously: “Yes, I
admit that might be possible — his being sincere,
I mean. It just didn’t happen to occur to me,
that’s all. I’m surprised,” and the seriousness
changed to mockery, “that you should have expected it to. Or did you really?”</p>
<p>“You don’t, I’m sure, imagine that that
Is a question that I can answer,” Irene told her.
“Not here and now.”</p>
<p>Gertrude’s face expressed complete be wilderment. However, seeing that little smiles
had come out on the faces of the two other
women and not recognizing them for the smiles
of mutual reservations which they were, she
smiled too.</p>
<p>Clare began to talk, steering carefully
away from anything that might lead towards
race or other thorny subjects. It was the most
brilliant exhibition of conversational weightlifting that Irene had ever seen. Her words
swept over them in charming well-modulated
streams. Her laughs tinkled and pealed. Her
little stories sparkled.</p>
<p>Irene contributed a bare “Yes” or
“No” here and there. Gertrude, a “You don’t
say!” less frequently.</p>
<p>For a while the Illusion of general conversation was nearly perfect. Irene felt her resentment changing gradually to a silent, somewhat grudging admiration.</p>
<p>Clare talked on, her voice, her gestures,
colouring all she said of wartime In France, of
after-the-wartlme In Germany, of the excitement at the time of the general strike in Eng land, of dressmaker’s openings in Paris, of the
new gaiety of Budapest.</p>
<p>But It couldn’t last, this verbal feat.
Gertrude shifted In her seat and fell to fidgeting with her fingers. Irene, bored at last by all
this repetition of the selfsame things that she
had read all too often in papers, magazines, and
books, set down her glass and collected her bag
and handkerchief. She was smoothing out the
tan fingers of her gloves preparatory to putting them on when she heard the sound of the
outer door being opened and saw Clare spring
up with an expression of relief saying: “How
lovely! Here’s Jack at exactly the right minute.
You can’t go now, ‘Rene dear.”</p>
<p>John Bellew came Into the room. The
first thing that Irene noticed about him was
that he was not the man that she had seen
with Clare Kendry on the Drayton roof. This
man, Clare’s husband, was a talllsh person,
broadly made. His age she guessed to be somewhere between thirty-five and forty. His hair
was dark brown and waving, and he had a soft
mouth,  somewhat  womanish,  set  In  an  unhealthy-looking dough-coloured face. His steelgrey opaque eyes were very much alive, moving
ceaselessly between thick bluish lids. But there
was, Irene decided, nothing unusual about him,
unless it was an Impression of latent physical
power.</p>
<p>“Hello, Nig,” was his greeting to
Clare.</p>
<p>Gertrude who had started slightly, settled back and looked covertly towards Irene,
who had caught her lip between her teeth and
sat gazing at husband and wife. It was hard to
believe that even Clare Kendry would permit
this ridiculing of her race by an outsider,
though he chanced to be her husband. So he
knew, then, that Clare was a Negro? From her
talk the other day Irene had understood that
he didn’t. But how rude, how positively Insulting, for him to address her in that way in the
presence of guests !</p>
<p>In Clare’s eyes, as she presented her
husband, was a queer gleam, a jeer. It might be.
Irene couldn’t define It.</p>
<p>The mechanical professions that attend  an introduction over, she inquired: “Did you
hear what Jack called me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gertrude answered, laughing
with a dutiful eagerness.</p>
<p>Irene didn’t speak. Her gaze remained
level on Clare’s smiling face.</p>
<p>The black eyes fluttered down. “Tell
them, dear, why you call me that.”</p>
<p>The man chuckled, crinkling up his eyes,
not, Irene was compelled to acknowledge, unpleasantly. He explained: “Well, you see, it’s
like this. When we were first married, she was
as white as — as — well as white as a lily. But
I declare she’s gettin’ darker and darker. I tell
her if she don’t look out, she’ll wake up one
of these days and find she’s turned into a
nigger.”</p>
<p>He roared with laughter. Clare’s ringing bell-like laugh joined his. Gertrude after
another uneasy shift in her seat added her
shrill one. Irene, who had been sitting with lips
tightly compressed, cried out: “That’s good!”
and gave way to gales of laughter. She laughed
and laughed and laughed. Tears ran down her
cheeks. Her sides ached. Her throat hurt. She
laughed on and on and on, long after the others had subsided. Until, catching sight of
Clare’s face, the need for a more quiet enjoyment of this priceless joke, and for caution,
struck her. At once she stopped.</p>
<p>Clare handed her husband his tea and
laid her hand on his arm with an affectionate
little gesture. Speaking with confidence as well
as with amusement, she said: “My goodness,
Jack! What difference would it make if, after
all these years, you were to find out that I was
one or two per cent coloured?”</p>
<p>Bellew put out his hand in a repudiating fling, definite and final. “Oh, no. Nig,” he
declared, “nothing like that with me. I know
you’re no nigger, so it’s all right. You can get
as black as you please as far as I’m concerned,
since I know you’re no nigger. I draw the line
at that. No niggers in my family. Never have
been and never will be.”</p>
<p>Irene’s lips trembled almost uncontrollably, but she made a desperate effort to fight
back her disastrous desire to laugh again, and
succeeded. Carefully selecting a cigarette from
the lacquered box on the tea-table before her,
she turned an oblique look on Clare and encountered her peculiar eyes fixed on her with
an expression so dark and deep and unfathomable that she had for a short moment the sensation of gazing into the eyes of some creature
utterly strange and apart. A faint sense of danger brushed her, like the breath of a cold fog.
Absurd, her reason told her, as she accepted
Bellew’s proffered light for her cigarette. Another glance at Clare showed her smiling. So,
as one always ready to oblige, was Gertrude.</p>
<p>An on-looker, Irene reflected, would
have thought It a most congenial tea-party, all
smiles and jokes and hilarious laughter. She
said humorously : ‘’So you dislike Negroes, Mr.
Bellew?” But her amusement was at her
thought, rather than her words.</p>
<p>John Bellew gave a short denying laugh.
“You got me wrong there, Mrs. Redfield.
Nothing like that at all. I don’t dislike them, I
hate them. And so does Nig, for all she’s trying to turn Into one. She wouldn’t have a nigger
maid around her for love nor money. Not that
I’d want her to. They give me the creeps. The
black scrlmy devils.’’</p>
<p>This wasn’t funny. Had Bellew, Irene
inquired, ever known any Negroes? The defensive tone of her voice brought another start
from the uncomfortable Gertrude, and, for all
her appearance of serenity, a quick apprehensive look from Clare.</p>
<p>Bellew answered: “Thank the Lord,
no! And never expect to! But I know people
who’ve known them, better than they know
their black selves. And I read in the papers
about them. Always robbing and killing people.
And,” he added darkly, “worse.”</p>
<p>From Gertrude’s direction came a queer
little suppressed sound, a snort or a giggle.
Irene couldn’t tell which. There was a brief
silence, during which she feared that her selfcontrol was about to prove too frail a bridge
to support her mounting anger and indignation.
She had a leaping desire to shout at the man
beside her: “And you’re sitting here surrounded
by three black devils, drinking tea.”
The impulse passed, obliterated by her
consciousness of the danger in which such rashness would involve Clare, who remarked with
a gentle reprovingness : “Jack dear, I’m sure
‘Rene doesn’t care to hear all about your pet
aversions. Nor Gertrude either. Maybe they
read the papers too, you know.” She smiled on
him, and her smile seemed to transform him,
to soften and mellow him, as the rays of the
sun does a fruit.</p>
<p>“All right. Nig, old girl. I’m sorry,”
he apologized. Reaching over, he playfully
touched his wife’s pale hands, then turned back
to Irene. “Didn’t mean to bore you, Mrs. Redfield. Hope you’ll excuse me,” he said sheepishly. “Clare tells me you’re living in New
York. Great city. New York. The city of the
future.”</p>
<p>In Irene, rage had not retreated, but
was held by some dam of caution and allegiance
to Clare. So, in the best casual voice she could
muster, she agreed with Bellew. Though, she
reminded him, it was exactly what Chicagoans
were apt to say of their city. And all the while
she was speaking, she was thinking how amazing it was that her voice did not tremble, that
outwardly she was calm. Only her hands shook
slightly. She drew them inward from their rest
in her lap and pressed the tips of her fingers
together to still them.</p>
<p>“Husband’s a doctor, I understand.
Manhattan, or one of the other boroughs?”</p>
<p>Manhattan, Irene informed him, and
explained the need for Brian to be within easy
reach of certain hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>“Interesting life, a doctor’s.”</p>
<p>“Ye-es. Hard, though. And, in a way,
monotonous. Nerve-racking too.”</p>
<p>“Hard on the wife’s nerves at least,
eh? So many lady patients.” He laughed, enjoying, with a boyish heartiness, the hoary
joke.</p>
<p>Irene managed a momentary smile, but
her voice was sober as she said: “Brian doesn’t
care for ladies, especially sick ones. I sometimes wish he did. It’s South America that attracts him.”</p>
<p>“Coming place, South America, if they  ever get the niggers out of it. It’s run over — “</p>
<p>“Really, Jack!” Clare’s voice was on
the edge of temper.</p>
<p>“Honestly, Nig, I forgot.” To the
others he said: “You see how hen-pecked I
am.” And to Gertrude: “You’re still in Chicago, Mrs. — er — Mrs. Martin?”</p>
<p>He was, it was plain, doing his best to
be agreeable to these old friends of Clare’s.
Irene had to concede that under other conditions she might have liked him. A fairly goodlooking man of amiable disposition, evidently,
and in easy circumstances. Plain and with no
nonsense about him.</p>
<p>Gertrude replied that Chicago was
good enough for her. She’d never been out of it
and didn’t think she ever should. Her husband’s business was there.</p>
<p>“Of course, of course. Can’t jump up
and leave a business.”</p>
<p>There followed a smooth surface of
talk about Chicago, New York, their differences and their recent spectacular changes.</p>
<p>It  was,  Irene,  thought,  unbelievable
and astonishing that four people could sit so
unruffled, so ostensibly friendly, while they
were In reality seething with anger, mortification, shame. But no, on second thought she
was forced to amend her opinion. John Bellew,
most certainly, was as undisturbed within as
without. So, perhaps, was Gertrude Martin. At
least she hadn’t the mortification and shame
that Clare Kendry must be feeling, or. In such
full measure, the rage and rebellion that she,
Irene, was repressing.</p>
<p>“More tea, ‘Rene,” Clare offered.</p>
<p>“Thanks, no. And I must be going. I’m
leaving tomorrow, you know, and I’ve still got
packing to do.”</p>
<p>She stood up. So did Gertrude, and
Clare, and John Bellew.</p>
<p>“How do you like the Drayton, Mrs.
Redfield?” the latter asked.</p>
<p>“The Drayton? Oh, very much. Very
much Indeed,” Irene answered, her scornful
eyes on Clare’s unrevealing face.</p>
<p>“Nice place, all right. Stayed there a
time or two myself,” the man informed her.
“Yes, Jt is nice,” Irene agreed. “Almost
as good as our best New York places.” She had
withdrawn her look from Clare and was searching in her bag for some non-existent something.
Her understanding was rapidly increasing, as
was her pity and her contempt. Clare was so
daring, so lovely, and so “having.”</p>
<p>They gave their hands to Clare with
appropriate murmurs. “So good to have seen
you.” …  “I  do  hope  I’ll  see  you  again</p>
<p>soon.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye,” Clare returned. “It was
good of you to come, ‘Rene dear. And you too,
Gertrude.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Bellew.” … “So
glad to have met you.” It was Gertrude who
had said that. Irene couldn’t, she absolutely
couldn’t bring herself to utter the polite fiction or anything approaching it.</p>
<p>He accompanied them out into the hall,
summoned the elevator.</p>
<p>“Good-bye,” they said again, stepping
in.</p>
<p>Plunging downward they were silent.
They made their way through the lobby
without speaking.</p>
<p>But as soon as they had reached the
street Gertrude, In the manner of one unable
to keep bottled up for another minute that
which for the last hour she had had to retain,
burst out: “My God! What an awful chance!
She must be plumb crazy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, It certainly seems risky,” Irene admitted.</p>
<p>“Risky! I should say It was. Risky! My
God ! What a word ! And the mess she’s liable
to get herself Into!”</p>
<p>“Still, I Imagine she’s pretty safe. They
don’t live here, you know. And there’s a child.
That’s a certain security.”</p>
<p>“It’s an awful chance, just the same,”
Gertrude Insisted. “I’d never In the world have
married Fred without him knowing. You can’t
tell what will turn up.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do agree that It’s safer to tell.
But then Bellew wouldn’t have married her.
And, after all, that’s what she wanted.”</p>
<p>Gertrude shook her head. “I wouldn’t
be in her shoes for all the money she’s getting
out of it, when he finds out. Not with him feeling the way he does. Gee! Wasn’t it awful?
For a minute I was so mad I could have
slapped him.”</p>
<p>It had been, Irene acknowledged, a distinctly trying experience, as well as a very unpleasant one. “I was more than a little angry
myself.”</p>
<p>“And imagine her not telling us about
him feeling that way ! Anything might have
happened. We might have said something.”</p>
<p>That, Irene pointed out, was exactly
like Clare Kendry. Taking a chance, and not at
all considering anyone else’s feelings.</p>
<p>Gertrude said: “Maybe she thought
we’d think it a good joke. And I guess you did.
The way you laughed. My land! I was scared
to death he might catch on.”</p>
<p>“Well, it was rather a joke,” Irene told
her, “on him and us and maybe on her.”</p>
<p>“All the same, it’s an awful chance. I’d
hate to be her.”</p>
<p>“She seems satisfied enough. She’s got
what she wanted, and the other day she told
me It was worth It.’’</p>
<p>But about that Gertrude was sceptical.
“She’ll find out different,” was her verdict.
“She’ll find out different all right.”</p>
<p>Rain had begun to fall, a few scattered
large drops.</p>
<p>The end-of-the-day crowds were scurrying In the directions of street-cars and elevated
roads.</p>
<p>Irene said: “You’re going south? I’m
sorry. I’ve got an errand. If you don’t mind,
I’ll just say good-bye here. It has been nice
seeing you, Gertrude. Say hello to Fred for
me, and to your mother If she remembers me.
Good-bye.”</p>
<p>She had wanted to be free of the other
woman, to be alone; for she was still sore and
angry.</p>
<p>What right, she kept demanding of herself, had Clare Kendry to expose her, or even
Gertrude Martin, to such humiliation, such
downright Insult?</p>
<p>And all the while, on the rushing ride
out to her father’s house, Irene Redfield was
trying to understand the look on Clare’s face
as she had said good-bye. Partly mocking, it
had seemed, and partly menacing. And something else for which she could find no name.
For an instant a recrudescence of that sensation of fear which she had had while looking
into Clare’s eyes that afternoon touched her.
A slight shiver ran over her.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” she told herself. “Just
somebody walking over my grave, as the children say.” She tried a tiny laugh and was annoyed to find that it was close to tears.</p>
<p>What a state she had allowed that horrible Bellew to get her into !</p>
<p>And late that night, even, long after the
last guest had gone and the old house was
quiet, she stood at her window frowning out
Into the dark rain and puzzling again over that
look on Clare’s incredibly beautiful face. She
couldn’t, however, come to any conclusion
about Its meaning, try as she might. It was unfathomable, utterly beyond any experience or
comprehension of hers.
She turned away from the window, at
last, with a still deeper frown. Why, after all,
worry about Clare Kendry? She was well able
to take care of herself, had always been able.
And there were, for Irene, other things, more
personal and more Important to worry about.</p>
<p>Besides, her reason told her, she had
only herself to blame for her disagreeable afternoon and Its attendant fears and questions.
She ought never to have gone.</p>
