<h1>Two<a class="headerlink" href="#two" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This is what Irene Redfield remembered.</p>
<p>Chicago. August. A brilliant day, hot,
with a brutal staring sun pouring down rays
that were like molten rain. A day on which the
very outlines of the buildings shuddered as if
In protest at the heat. Quivering lines sprang
up from baked pavements and wriggled along
the shining car-tracks. The automobiles parked
at the kerbs were a dancing blaze, and the
glass of the shop-windows threw out a blinding radiance. Sharp particles of dust rose from
the burning sidewalks, stinging the seared or
dripping skins of wilting pedestrians. What
small breeze there was seemed like the breath
of a flame fanned by slow bellows.</p>
<p>It was on that day of all others that
Irene set out to shop for the things which
she had promised to take home from Chicago
to her two small sons, Brian junior and Theodore. Characteristically, she had put it off un til only a few crowded days remained of her
long visit. And only this sweltering one was
free of engagements till the evening.</p>
<p>Without too much trouble she had got
the mechanical aeroplane for Junior. But the
drawing-book, for which Ted had so gravely
and insistently given her precise directions, had
sent her in and out of five shops without success.</p>
<p>It was while she was on her way to a
sixth place that right before her smarting eyes
a man toppled over and became an inert
crumpled heap on the scorching cement. About
the lifeless figure a little crowd gathered. Was
the man dead, or only faint? someone asked
her. But Irene didn’t know and didn’t try to
discover. She edged her way out of the increasing crowd, feeling disagreeably damp and
sticky and soiled from contact with so many
sweating bodies.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood fanning herself and dabbing at her moist face with an Inadequate scrap of handkerchief. Suddenly she
was aware that the whole street had a wobbly
look, and realized that she was about to faint.
With a quick perception of the need for Immediate safety, she lifted a wavering hand In
the direction of a cab parked directly In front
of her. The perspiring driver jumped out and
guided her to his car. He helped, almost lifted
her In. She sank down on the hot leather seat.</p>
<p>For a minute her thoughts were nebulous. They cleared.</p>
<p>“I guess,” she told her Samaritan, “It’s
tea I need. On a roof somewhere.”</p>
<p>“The Drayton, ma’am?” he suggested.
“They do say as how it’s always a breeze up
there.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I think the Drayton’ll do
nicely,” she told him.</p>
<p>There was that little grating sound of
the clutch being slipped in as the man put
the car in gear and slid deftly out into the boiling traffic. Reviving under the warm breeze
stirred up by the moving cab, Irene made some
small attempts to repair the damage that the
heat and crowds had done to her appearance.
All too soon the rattling vehicle shot
towards the sidewalk and stood still. The
driver sprang out and opened the door before
the hotel’s decorated attendant could reach It.
She got out, and thanking him smilingly as well
as in a more substantial manner for his kind
helpfulness and understanding, went In through
the Drayton’s wide doors.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the elevator that had
brought her to the roof, she was led to a table
just In front of a long window whose gently
moving curtains suggested a cool breeze. It
was, she thought, like being wafted upward on
a magic carpet to another world, pleasant,
quiet, and strangely remote from the sizzling
one that she had left below.</p>
<p>The tea, when it came, was all that
she had desired and expected. In fact, so much
was it what she had desired and expected that
after the first deep cooling drink she was able
to forget It, only now and then sipping, a little
absently, from the tall green glass, while she
surveyed the room about her or looked out
over some lower buildings at the bright un Stirred blue of the lake reaching away to an
undetected horizon.</p>
<p>She had been gazing down for some
time at the specks of cars and people creeping
about in streets, and thinking how silly they
looked, when on taking up her glass she was
surprised to find it empty at last. She asked
for more tea and while she waited, began to recall the happenings of the day and to wonder
what she was to do about Ted and his book.
Why was it that almost invariably he wanted
something that was difficult or impossible to
get? Like his father. For ever wanting something that he couldn’t have.</p>
<p>Presently there were voices, a man’s
booming one and a woman’s slightly husky. A
waiter passed her, followed by a sweetly
scented woman in a fluttering dress of green
chifi^on whose mingled pattern of narcissuses,
jonquils, and hyacinths was a reminder of pleasantly chill spring days. Behind her there was
a man, very red In the face, who was mopping
his neck and forehead with a big crumpled
handkerchief.
“Oh dear I” Irene groaned, rasped by
annoyance, for after a little discussion and commotion they had stopped at the very next table.
She had been alone there at the window and
It had been so satisfylngly quiet. Now, of
course, they would chatter.</p>
<p>But no. Only the woman sat down. The
man remained standing, abstractedly pinching
the knot of his bright blue tie. Across the small
space that separated the two tables his voice
carried clearly.</p>
<p>“See you later, then,” he declared, looking down at the woman. There was pleasure
in his tones and a smile on his face.</p>
<p>His companion’s lips parted In some
answer, but her words were blurred by the
little intervening distance and the medley of
noises floating up from the streets below. They
didn’t reach Irene. But she noted the peculiar
caressing smile that accompanied them.</p>
<p>The man said: “Well, I suppose I’d
better,” and smiled again, and said good-bye,
and left.</p>
<p>An   attractive-looking   woman,   was
Irene’s opinion, with those dark, almost black,
eyes and that wide mouth like a scarlet flower
against the Ivory of her skin. Nice clothes too,
just right for the weather, thin and cool without being mussy, as summer things were so
apt to be.</p>
<p>A waiter was taking her order. Irene
saw her smile up at him as she murmured something— thanks, maybe. It was an odd sort of
smile. Irene couldn’t quite define it, but she
was sure that she would have classed It, coming from another woman, as being just a shade
too provocative for a waiter. About this one,
however, there was something that made her
hesitate to name It that. A certain impression
of assurance, perhaps.</p>
<p>The waiter came back with the order.
Irene watched her spread out her napkin, saw
the silver spoon in the white hand slit the dull
gold of the melon. Then, conscious that she had
been staring, she looked quickly away.</p>
<p>Her mind returned to her own affairs.
She had settled, definitely, the problem of the
proper one of two frocks for the bridge party
that night, In rooms whose atmosphere would
be so thick and hot that every breath would be
like breathing soup. The dress decided, her
thoughts had gone back to the snag of Ted’s
book, her unseeing eyes far away on the lake,
when by some sixth sense she was acutely
aware that someone was watching her.</p>
<p>Very slowly she looked around, and
into the dark eyes of the woman In the green
frock at the next table. But she evidently failed
to realize that such intense interest as she was
showing might be embarrassing, and continued
to stare. Her demeanour was that of one who
with utmost singleness of mind and purpose
was determined to impress firmly and accurately each detail of Irene’s features upon her
memory for all time, nor showed the slightest
trace of disconcertment at having been detected
in her steady scrutiny.</p>
<p>Instead, it was Irene who was put out.
Feeling her colour heighten under the continued
Inspection, she slid her eyes down. What, she
wondered, could be the reason for such persistent attention? Had she. In her haste In the
taxi, put her hat on backwards? Guardedly she
felt at it. No. Perhaps there was a streak of
powder somewhere on her face. She made a
quick pass over it with her handkerchief. Something wrong with her dress? She shot a glance
over it. Perfectly all right. What was it?</p>
<p>Again she looked up, and for a moment her brown eyes politely returned the
stare of the other’s black ones, which never
for an instant fell or wavered. Irene made a
little mental shrug. Oh well, let her look! She
tried to treat the woman and her watching
with indifference, but she couldn’t. All her efforts to ignore her, it, were futile. She stole
another glance. Still looking. What strange
languorous eyes she had!</p>
<p>And gradually there rose in Irene a
small inner disturbance, odious and hatefully
familiar. She laughed softly, but her eyes
flashed.</p>
<p>Did that woman, could that woman,
somehow know that here before her very eyes
on the roof of the Drayton sat a Negro?</p>
<p>Absurd! Impossible! White people were  SO stupid about such things for all that they
usually asserted that they were able to tell; and
by the most ridiculous means, finger-nails,
palms of hands, shapes of ears, teeth, and
other equally silly rot. They always took her
for an Italian, a Spaniard, a Mexican, or a
gipsy. Never, when she was alone, had they
even remotely seemed to suspect that she was a
Negro. No, the woman sitting there staring at
her couldn’t possibly know.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Irene felt, in turn, anger,
scorn, and fear slide over her. It wasn’t that
she was ashamed of being a Negro, or even of
having it declared. It was the idea of being
ejected from any place, even in the polite and
tactful way in which the Drayton would probably do it, that disturbed her.</p>
<p>But she looked, boldly this time, back
into the eyes still frankly intent upon her.
They did not seem to her hostile or resentful.
Rather, Irene had the feeling that they were
ready to smile if she would. Nonsense, of
course. The feeling passed, and she turned
away with the firm intention of keeping her
gaze on the lake, the roofs of the buildings
across the way, the sky, anywhere but on that
annoying woman. Almost immediately, however, her eyes were back again. In the midst of
her fog of uneasiness she had been seized by a
desire to outstare the rude observer. Suppose
the woman did know or suspect her race. She
couldn’t prove it.</p>
<p>Suddenly her small fright Increased.
Her neighbour had risen and was coming
towards her. What was going to happen now?</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” the woman said pleasantly, “but I think I know you.” Her slightly
husky voice held a dubious note.</p>
<p>Looking up at her, Irene’s suspicions
and fears vanished. There was no mistaking
the friendliness of that smile or resisting Its
charm. Instantly she surrendered to it and
smiled too, as she said: “I’m afraid you’re mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Why, of course, I know you!” the
other exclaimed. “Don’t tell me you’re not
Irene Westover. Or do they still call you
‘Rene?”
In the brief second before her answer,
Irene tried vainly to recall where and when
this woman could have known her. There, in
Chicago. And before her marriage. That much
was plain. High school? College? Y. W. C. A.
committees? High school, most likely. What
white girls had she known well enough to have
been familiarly addressed as ‘Rene by them?
The woman before her didn’t fit her memory
of any of them. Who was she?</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m Irene Westover. And though
nobody calls me ‘Rene any more, it’s good to
hear the name again. And you — “ She hesitated, ashamed that she could not remember,
and hoping that the sentence would be finished
for her.</p>
<p>“Don’t .you know me? Not really,
‘Rene?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but just at the minute I
can’t seem to place you.”</p>
<p>Irene studied the lovely creature standing beside her for some clue to her identity.
Who could she be? Where and when had they
met? And through her perplexity there came
the thought that the trick which her memory
had played her was for some reason more
gratifying than disappointing to her old acquaintance, that she didn’t mind not being
recognized.</p>
<p>And, too, Irene felt that she was just
about to remember her. For about the woman
was some quality, an intangible something, too
vague to define, too remote to seize, but which
was, to Irene Redfield, very familiar. And that
voice. Surely she’d heard those husky tones
somewhere before. Perhaps before time, contact, or something had been at them, making
them into a voice remotely suggesting England.
Ah ! Could it have been in Europe that they
had met? ‘Rene. No.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Irene began, “you — “</p>
<p>The woman laughed, a lovely laugh, a
small sequence of notes that was like a trill and
also like the ringing of a delicate bell fashioned
of a precious metal, a tinkling.</p>
<p>Irene drew a quick sharp breath.
“Clare!” she exclaimed, “not really Clare
Kendry?”
So great was her astonishment that she
had started to rise.</p>
<p>“No, no, don’t get up,” Clare Kendry
commanded, and sat down herself. “You’ve
simply got to stay and talk. We’ll have something more. Tea ? Fancy meeting you here ! It’s
simply too, too lucky!”</p>
<p>“It’s awfully surprising,” Irene told
her, and, seeing the change In Clare’s smile,
knew that she had revealed a corner of her
own thoughts. But she only said: “I’d never
In this world have known you If you hadn’t
laughed. You are changed, you know. And yet,
in a way, you’re just the same.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Clare replied. “Oh, just a
second.”</p>
<p>She gave her attention to the waiter
at her side. “M-mm, let’s see. Two teas. And
bring some cigarettes. Y-es, they’ll be all right.
Thanks.” Again that odd upward smile. Now,
Irene was sure that it was too provocative for
a waiter.</p>
<p>While Clare had been giving the order,
Irene made a rapid mental calculation. It must
be, she figured, all of twelve years since she,
or anybody that she knew, had laid eyes on
Clare Kendry.</p>
<p>After her father’s death she’d gone to
live with some relatives, aunts or cousins two or
three times removed, over on the west side :
relatives that nobody had known the Kendry’s
possessed until they had turned up at the funeral and taken Clare away with them.</p>
<p>For about a year or more afterwards
she would appear occasionally among her old
friends and acquaintances on the south side for
short little visits that were, they understood,
always stolen from the endless domestic tasks
in her new home. With each succeeding one
she was taller, shabbier, and more belligerently
sensitive. And each time the look on her face
was more resentful and brooding. “I’m worried about Clare, she seems so unhappy,” Irene
remembered her mother saying. The visits
dwindled, becoming shorter, fewer, and further
apart until at last they ceased.</p>
<p>Irene’s father, who had been fond of
Bob Kendry, made a special trip over to the
west side about two months after the last time
Clare had been to see them and returned with
the bare information that he had seen the relatives and that Clare had disappeared. What
else he had confided to her mother, in the privacy of their own room, Irene didn’t know.</p>
<p>But she had had something more than a
vague suspicion of its nature. For there had
been rumours. Rumours that were, to girls of
eighteen and nineteen years, interesting and
exciting.</p>
<p>There was the one about Clare Kendry’s having been seen at the dinner hour in a
fashionable hotel in company with another
woman and two men, all of them white. And
dressed! And there was another which told of
her driving in Lincoln Park with a man, unmistakably white, and evidently rich. Packard
limousine, chauffeur in livery, and all that.
There had been others whose context Irene
could no longer recollect, but all pointing in
the same glamorous direction.</p>
<p>And she could remember quite vividly
how, when they used to repeat and discuss these
tantalizing stories about Clare, the girls would
always look knowingly at one another and then,
with little excited giggles, drag away their
eager shining eyes and say with lurking undertones of regret or disbelief some such thing as:
“Oh, well, maybe she’s got a job or something,”
or “After all, it mayn’t have been Clare,” or
“You can’t believe all you hear.”</p>
<p>And always some girl, more matter-offact or more frankly malicious than the rest,
would declare: “Of course it was Clare! Ruth
said it was and so did Frank, and they certainly know her when they see her as well as
we do.” And someone else would say: “Yes,
you can bet it was Clare all right.” And then
they would all join in asserting that there could
be no mistake about it’s having been Clare,
and that such circumstances could mean only
one thing. Working indeed! People didn’t take
their servants to the Shelby for dinner. Certainly not all dressed up like that. There would
follow insincere regrets, and somebody would
say: “Poor girl, I suppose it’s true enough, but
what can you expect. Look at her father. And
her mother, they say, would have run away If
she hadn’t died. Besides, Clare always had a —
a — having way with her.”</p>
<p>Precisely that ! The words came to Irene
as she sat there on the Drayton roof, facing
Clare Kendry. “A having way.” Well, Irene
acknowledged, judging from her appearance
and manner, Clare seemed certainly to have
succeeded In having a few of the things that
she wanted.</p>
<p>It was, Irene repeated, after the Interval of the waiter, a great surprise and a very
pleasant one to see Clare again after all those
years, twelve at least.</p>
<p>“Why, Clare, you’re the last person In
the world I’d have expected to run Into. I guess
that’s why I didn’t know you.”</p>
<p>Clare answered gravely: “Yes. It Is
twelve years. But I’m not surprised to see you,
‘Rene. That Is, not so very. In fact, ever since
I’ve been here, I’ve more or less hoped that I
should, or someone.  Preferably you, though.
Still, I Imagine that’s because I’ve thought of
you often and often, while you — I’ll wager
you’ve never given me a thought.”</p>
<p>It was true, of course. After the first
speculations and indictments, Clare had gone
completely from Irene’s thoughts. And from
the thoughts of others too — if their conversation was any indication of their thoughts.</p>
<p>Besides, Clare had never been exactly
one of the group, just as she’d never been
merely the janitor’s daughter, but the daughter
of Mr. Bob Kendry, who, it was true, was a
janitor, but who also, it seemed, had been in
college with some of their fathers. Just how or
why he happened to be a janitor, and a very inefficient one at that, they none of them quite
knew. One of Irene’s brothers, who had put the
question to their father, had been told: “That’s
something that doesn’t concern you,” and given
him the advice to be careful not to end in the
same manner as “poor Bob.”</p>
<p>No, Irene hadn’t thought of Clare
Kendry. Her own life had been too crowded.
So, she supposed, had the lives of other peo pie. She defended her — their — forgetfulness.
“You know how It is. Everybody’s so busy.
People leave, drop out, maybe for a little
while there’s talk about them, or questions;
then, gradually they’re forgotten.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s natural,” Clare agreed.
And what, she inquired, had they said of her
for that little while at the beginning before
they’d forgotten her altogether?</p>
<p>Irene looked away. She felt the telltale colour rising in her cheeks. “You can’t,”
she evaded, “expect me to remember trifles
like that over twelve years of marriages, births,
deaths, and the war.”</p>
<p>There followed that trill of notes that
was Clare Kendry’s laugh, small and clear and
the very essence of mockery.</p>
<p>“Oh, ‘Rene!” she cried, “of course you
remember I But I won’t make you tell me, because I know just as well as if I’d been there
and heard every unkind word. Oh, I know, I
know. Frank Danton saw me in the Shelby
one night. Don’t tell me he didn’t broadcast
that, and with embroidery. Others may have
seen me at other times. I don’t know. But once
I met Margaret Hammer In Marshall Field’s.
I’d have spoken, was on the very point of doing
it, but she cut me dead. My dear ‘Rene, I assure you that from the way she looked through
me, even I was uncertain whether I was actually
there In the flesh or not. I remember It clearly,
too clearly. It was that very thing which, In
a way, finally decided me not to go out and
see you one last time before I went away to
stay. Somehow, good as all of you, the whole
family, had always been to the poor forlorn
child that was me, I felt I shouldn’t be able
to bear that. I mean if any of you, your mother
or the boys or — Oh, well, I just felt I’d rather
not know It if you did. And so I stayed away.
Silly, I suppose. Sometimes I’ve been sorry I
didn’t go.”</p>
<p>Irene wondered if it was tears that
made Clare’s eyes so luminous.</p>
<p>“And now ‘Rene, I want to hear all
about you and everybody and everything.
You’re married, I s’pose?”</p>
<p>Irene nodded.
“Yes,”  Clare  said  knowingly,  “you
would be. Tell me about it/’</p>
<p>And so for an hour or more they had
sat there smoking and drinking tea and filling
in the gap of twelve years with talk. That is,
Irene did. She told Clare about her marriage
and removal to New York, about her husband,
and about her two sons, who were having their
first experience of being separated from their
parents at a summer camp, about her mother’s
death, about the marriages of her two brothers.
She told of the marriages, births and deaths In
other families that Clare had known, opening
up, for her, new vistas on the lives of old
friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>Clare drank it all In, these things which
for so long she had wanted to know and hadn’t
been able to learn. She sat motionless, her
bright lips slightly parted, her whole face lit by
the radiance of her happy eyes. Now and then
she put a question, but for the most part she
was silent.</p>
<p>Somewhere outside, a clock struck.
Brought back to the present, Irene looked down
at her watch and exclaimed: “Oh, I must go,
Clare!”</p>
<p>A moment passed during which she was
the prey of uneasiness. It had suddenly occurred
to her that she hadn’t asked Clare anything
about her own life and that she had a very
definite unwillingness to do so. And she was
quite well aware of the reason for that reluctance. But, she asked herself, wouldn’t it,
all things considered, be the kindest thing not
to ask? If things with Clare were as she — as
they all — had suspected, wouldn’t it be more
tactful to seem to forget to Inquire how she
had spent those twelve years?</p>
<p>Iff It was that “if” which bothered her.
It might be, it might just be, in spite of all gossip and even appearances to the contrary, that
there was nothing, had been nothing, that
couldn’t be simply and innocently explained.
Appearances, she knew now, had a way sometimes of not fitting facts, and if Clare hadn’t —
Well, If they had all been wrong, then certainly
she ought to express some Interest In what had
happened to her. It would seem queer and rude
if she didn’t. But how was she to know? There
was, she at last decided, no way; so she merely
said again. “I must go, Clare.”</p>
<p>“Please, not so soon, ‘Rene,” Clare
begged, not moving.</p>
<p>Irene thought: ‘’She’s really almost too
good-looking. It’s hardly any wonder that
she—”</p>
<p>‘’And now, ‘Rene dear, that I’ve found
you, I mean to see lots and lots of you. We’re
here for a month at least. Jack, that’s my husband, is here on business. Poor dear! in this
heat. Isn’t it beastly? Come to dinner with us
tonight, won’t you?” And she gave Irene a curious little sidelong glance and a sly, ironical
smile peeped out on her full red lips, as if she
had been in the secret of the other’s thoughts
,  and was mocking her.</p>
<p>Irene was conscious of a sharp intake
of breath, but whether it was relief or chagrin
that she felt, she herself could not have told.
She said hastily: “I’m afraid I can’t, Clare. I’m
filled up. Dinner and bridge. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“Come tomorrow instead, to tea,” Clare
insisted. “Then you’ll see Margery — she’s just
ten — and Jack too, maybe, if he hasn’t got an
appointment or something.”</p>
<p>From Irene came an uneasy little laugh.
She had an engagement for tomorrow also and
she was afraid that Clare would not believe It.
Suddenly, now, that possibility disturbed her.
Therefore It was with a half-vexed feeling at
the sense of undeserved guilt that had come
upon her that she explained that It wouldn’t
be possible because she wouldn’t be free for
tea, or for luncheon or dinner either. “And the
next day’s Friday when I’ll be going away for
the week-end, Idlewlld, you know. It’s quite
the thing now.” And then she had an Inspira*
tlon.</p>
<p>“Clare!” she exclaimed, “why don’t
you come up with me? Our place Is probably
full up — Jim’s wife has a way of collecting
mobs of the most Impossible people — but we
can always manage to find room for one more.
And you’ll see absolutely everybody.”</p>
<p>In the very moment of giving the in vltatlon she regretted It. What a foolish, what
an idiotic Impulse to have given way to ! She
groaned Inwardly as she thought of the endless
explanations In which it would Involve her, of
the curiosity, and the talk, and the lifted eyebrows. It wasn’t she assured herself, that she
was a snob, that she cared greatly for the petty
restrictions and distinctions with which what
called Itself Negro society chose to hedge Itself about; but that she had a natural and
deeply rooted aversion to the kind of frontpage notoriety that Clare Kendry’s presence In
Idlewlld, as her guest, would expose her to. And
here she was, perversely and against all reason,
inviting her.</p>
<p>But Clare shook her head. “Really, I’d
love to, ‘Rene,” she said, a little mournfully.
“There’s nothing I’d like better. But I couldn’t.
I mustn’t, you see. It wouldn’t do at all. I’m
sure you understand. I’m simply crazy to go,
but I can’t.” The dark eyes glistened and there
was a suspicion of a quaver in the husky voice.
“And believe me, ‘Rene, I do thank you for
asking me. Don’t think I’ve entirely forgotten
just what it would mean for you if I went. That
is, if you still care about such things.”</p>
<p>All indication of tears had gone from
her eyes and voice, and Irene Redfield, searching her face, had an offended feeling that behind what was now only an ivory mask lurked
a scornful amusement. She looked away, at the
wall far beyond Clare. Well, she deserved it,
for, as she acknowledged to herself, she was
relieved. And for the very reason at which
Clare had hinted. The fact that Clare had
guesssed her perturbation did not, however. In
any degree lessen that relief. She was annoyed
at having been detected in what might seem to
be an insincerity; but that was all.</p>
<p>The waiter came with Clare’s change.
Irene reminded herself that she ought immediately to go. But she didn’t move.</p>
<p>The truth was, she was curious. There
were things that she wanted to ask Clare Kendry. She wished to find out about this hazardous
business of “passing,” this breaking away from
all that was famihar and friendly to take one’s
chance in another environment, not entirely
strange, perhaps, but certainly not entirely
friendly. What, for example, one did about
background, how one accounted for oneself.
And how one felt when one came into contact
with other Negroes. But she couldn’t. She was
unable to think of a single question that in its
context or its phrasing was not too frankly curious, if not actually impertinent.</p>
<p>As if aware of her desire and her hesitation, Clare remarked, thoughtfully: “You
know, ‘Rene, I’ve often wondered why more
coloured girls, girls like you and Margaret
Hammer and Esther Dawson and — oh, lots of
others — never ^passed’ over. It’s such a frightfully easy thing to do. If one’s the type, all
that’s needed is a little nerve.”</p>
<p>“What about background? Family, I
mean. Surely you can’t just drop down on people from nowhere and expect them to receive
you with open arms, can you?”</p>
<p>“Almost,” Clare asserted. “You’d be
surprised, ‘Rene, how much easier that is with
white people than with us. Maybe because there
are so many more of them, or maybe because
they are secure and so don’t have to bother. I’ve
never quite decided.”</p>
<p>Irene was Inclined to be incredulous.
“You mean that you didn’t have to explain
where you came from? It seems impossible.”
Clare cast a .glance of repressed amusement across the table at her. “As a matter of
fact, I didn’t. Though I suppose under any
other circumstances I might have had to provide some plausible tale to account for myself.
I’ve a good imagination, so I’m sure I could
have done it quite creditably, and credibly. But
it wasn’t necessary. There were my aunts, you
see, respectable and authentic enough for anything or anybody.”</p>
<p>“I see. They were ‘passing’ too.”
“No. They weren’t. They were white.”
“Oh!” And in the next instant it came
back to Irene that she had heard this mentioned
before; by her father, or, more likely, her
mother. They were Bob Kendry’s aunts. He had
been a son of their brother’s, on the left hand.
A wild oat.
“They were nice old ladies,” Clare explained, “very religious and as poor as church
mice. That adored brother of theirs, my grandfather, got through every penny they had after
he’d finished his own little bit.”</p>
<p>Clare paused in her narrative to light
another cigarette. Her smile, her expression,
Irene noticed, was faintly resentful.</p>
<p>“Being good Christians,” she continued,
“when dad came to his tipsy end, they did their
duty and gave me a home of sorts. I was, it was
true, expected to earn my keep by doing all the
housework and most of the washing. But do you
realize, ‘Rene, that if it hadn’t been for them,
I shouldn’t have had a home in the world?”</p>
<p>Irene’s nod and little murmur were comprehensive, understanding.</p>
<p>Clare made a small mischievous grimace and proceeded. “Besides, to their notion,
hard labour was good for me. I had Negro
blood and they belonged to the generation that
had written and read long articles headed:
‘Will the Blacks Work?’ Too, they weren’t
quite sure that the good God hadn’t intended
the sons and daughters of Ham to sweat because he had poked fun at old man Noah once
when he had taken a drop too much. I remember the aunts telling me that that old drunkard
had cursed Ham and his sons for all time.”</p>
<p>Irene laughed. But Clare remained quite
serious.</p>
<p>“It was more than a joke, I assure you,
‘Rene. It was a hard life for a girl of sixteen.
Still, I had a roof over my head, and food, and
clothes — such as they were. And there were the
Scriptures, and talks on morals and thrift and
industry and the loving-kindness of the good
Lord.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever stopped to think,
Clare,” Irene demanded, “how much unhappiness and downright cruelty are laid to the loving-kindness of the Lord? And always by His
most ardent followers, it seems.”</p>
<p>“Have I?” Clare exclaimed. “It, they,
made me what I am today. For, of course, I
was determined to get away, to be a person
and not a charity or a problem, or even a
daughter of the indiscreet Ham. Then, too, I
wanted things. I knew I wasn’t bad-looking and
that I could ‘pass.’ You can’t know, ‘Rene, how,
when I used to go over to the south side, I
used almost to hate all of you. You had all the
things I wanted and never had had. It made me
all the more determined to get them, and others. Do you, can you understand what I felt?”</p>
<p>She looked up with a pointed and appealing effect, and, evidently finding the sympathetic expression on Irene’s face sufficient answer, went on. “The aunts were queer. For
all their Bibles and praying and ranting about
honesty, they didn’t want anyone to know that
their darling brother had seduced — ruined, they
called It — a Negro girl. They could excuse the
ruin, but they couldn’t forgive the tar-brush.
They forbade me to mention Negroes to the
neighbours, or even to mention the south side.
You may be sure that I didn’t. I’ll bet they
were good and sorry afterwards.”</p>
<p>She laughed and the ringing bells In
her laugh had a hard metallic sound.</p>
<p>“When the chance to get away came,
that omission was of great value to me. When
Jack, a schoolboy acquaintance of some people In the neighbourhood, turned up from
South America with untold gold, there was no
one to tell him that I was coloured, and many
to tell him about the severity and the religiousness of Aunt Grace and Aunt Edna. You can
guess the rest. After he came, I stopped slipping off to the south side and slipped off to meet
him Instead. I couldn’t manage both. In the
end I had no great difficulty In convincing him
that It was useless to talk marriage to the
aunts. So on the day that I was eighteen, we
went off and were married. So that’s that.
Nothing could have been easier.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do see that for you It was easy
enough. By the way ! I wonder why they didn’t
tell father that you were married. He went
over to find out about you when you stopped
coming over to see us. I’m sure they didn’t tell
him. Not that you were married.”</p>
<p>Clare Kendry’s eyes were bright with
tears that didn’t fall.  “Oh,  how lovely! To
have cared enough about me to do that. The
dear sweet man! Well, they couldn’t tell him
because they didn’t know it. I took care of that,
for I couldn’t be sure that those consciences of
theirs wouldn’t begin to work on them afterwards and make them let the cat out of the
bag. The old things probably thought I was
living In sin, wherever I was. And it would be
about what they expected.”</p>
<p>An amused smile lit the lovely face for
the smallest fraction of a second. After a little
silence she said soberly: “But I’m sorry if they
told your father so. That was something I
hadn’t counted on.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that they did,” Irene told
her. “He didn’t say so, anyway.”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t, ‘Rene dear. Not your
father.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’m sure he wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“But you’ve never answered my question. Tell me, honestly, haven’t you ever
thought of ‘passing’ ?”</p>
<p>Irene answered promptly: “No. Why
should I?” And so disdainful was her voice
and manner that Clare’s face flushed and her
eyes glinted. Irene hastened to add: “You see,
Clare, I’ve everything I want. Except, perhaps,
a little more money.”</p>
<p>At that Clare laughed, her spark of
anger vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
“Of course,” she declared, “that’s what everybody wants, just a little more money, even the
people who have it. And I must say I don’t
blame them. Money’s awfully nice to have. In
fact, all things considered, I think, ‘Rene, that
it’s even worth the price.”</p>
<p>Irene could only shrug her shoulders.
Her reason partly agreed, her instinct wholly
rebelled. And she could not say why. And
though conscious that if she didn’t hurry away,
she was going to be late to dinner, she still
lingered. It was as if the woman sitting on the
other side of the table, a girl that she had
known, who had done this rather dangerous
and, to Irene Redfield, abhorrent thing successfully and had announced herself well satisfied,
had for her a fascination, strange and compelling.</p>
<p>Clare Kendry was still leaning back in
the  tall  chair,  her  sloping  shoulders  against
the carved top. She sat with an air of indifferent assurance, as if arranged for, desired.
About her clung that dim suggestion of polite
insolence with which a few women are born
and which some acquire with the coming of
riches or importance.</p>
<p>Clare, it gave Irene a little prick of
satisfaction to recall, hadn’t got that by passing herself off as white. She herself had always
had it.</p>
<p>Just as she’d always had that pale gold
hair, which, unsheared still, was drawn loosely
back from a broad brow, partly hidden by the
small close hat. Her lips, painted a brilliant
geranium-red, were sweet and sensitive and a
little obstinate. A tempting mouth. The face
across the forehead and cheeks was a trifle too
wide, but the ivory skin had a peculiar soft
lustre. And the eyes were magnificent! dark,
sometimes absolutely black, always luminous,
and set in long, black lashes. Arresting eyes,
slow and mesmeric, and with, for all their
warmth, something withdrawn and secret about
them.
Ah! Surely! They were Negro eyes!
mysterious and concealing. And set in that ivory
face under that bright hair, there was about
them something exotic.</p>
<p>Yes, Clare Kendry’s loveliness was absolute, beyond challenge, thanks to those eyes
which her grandmother and later her mother
and father had given her.</p>
<p>Into those eyes there came a smile and
over Irene the sense of being petted and caressed. She smiled back.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Clare suggested, “you can
come Monday, if you’re back. Or, if you’re not,
then Tuesday.” ^</p>
<p>With a small regretful sigh, Irene informed Clare that she was afraid she wouldn’t
be back by Monday and that she was sure she
had dozens of things for Tuesday, and that she
was leaving Wednesday. It might be, however, that she could get out of something Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Oh, do try. Do put somebody else off.
The others can see you any time, while I — Why,
I  may never see you  again!  Think of that,
‘Rene! You’ll have to come. You’ll simply
have to ! I’ll never forgive you if you don’t.”</p>
<p>At that moment It seemed a dreadful
thing to think of never seeing Clare Kendry
again. Standing there under the appeal, the
caress, of her eyes, Irene had the desire, the
hope, that this parting wouldn’t be the last.</p>
<p>“I’ll try, Clare,” she promised gently.
“I’ll call you — or will you call me?”</p>
<p>“I think, perhaps, I’d better call you.
Your father’s In the book, I know, and the address Is the same. Sixty-four eighteen. Some
memory, what? Now remember, I’m going to
expect you. You’ve got to be able to come.”</p>
<p>Again that peculiar mellowing smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best, Clare.”</p>
<p>Irene gathered up her gloves and bag.
They stood up. She put out her hand. Clare
took and held It.</p>
<p>“It has been nice seeing you again,
Clare. How pleased and glad father’ll be to
hear about you!”</p>
<p>“Until Tuesday, then,” Clare Kendry
replied. “I’ll spend every minute of the time
from now on looking forward to seeing you
again. Good-bye, ‘Rene dear. My love to your
father, and this kiss for him.”</p>
<p>The sun had gone from overhead, but
the streets were still like fiery furnaces. The
languid breeze was still hot. And the scurrying people looked even more wilted than before Irene had fled from their contact.</p>
<p>Crossing the avenue In the heat, far
from the coolness of the Drayton’s roof, away
from the seduction of Clare Kendry’s smile,
she was aware of a sense of Irritation with herself because she had been pleased and a little
flattered at the other’s obvious gladness at their
meeting.</p>
<p>With her perspiring progress homeward
this irritation grew, and she began to wonder
just what had possessed her to make her promise to find time, In the crowded days that remained of her visit, to spend another afternoon
with a woman whose life had so definitely and
deliberately diverged from hers;  and whom,
as had been pointed out, she might never see
again.</p>
<p>Why In the world had she made such a
promise?</p>
<p>As she went up the steps to her father’s
house, thinking with what interest and amazement he would listen to her story of the afternoon’s encounter, It came to her that Clare
had omitted to mention her marriage name.
She had referred to her husband as Jack. That
was all. Had that, Irene asked herself, been
intentional ?</p>
<p>Clare had only to pick up the telephone
to communicate with her, or to drop her a card,
or to jump into a taxi. But she couldn’t reach
Clare in any way. Nor could anyone else to
whom she might speak of their meeting.</p>
<p>“As if I should!”</p>
<p>Her key turned In the lock. She went in.
Her father, it seemed, hadn’t come in yet.</p>
<p>Irene decided that she wouldn’t, after
all, say anything to him about Clare Kendry.
She  had,  she  told herself,  no  inclination  to
Speak of a person who held so low an opinion
of her loyalty, or her discretion. And certainly
she had no desire or Intention of making the
slightest effort about Tuesday. Nor any other
day for that matter.</p>
<p>She was through with Clare Kendry.</p>
