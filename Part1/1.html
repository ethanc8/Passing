<h1>One<a class="headerlink" href="#one" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>It was the last letter in Irene Redfield’s little
pile of morning mail. After her other ordinary
and clearly directed letters the long envelope
of thin Italian paper with its almost illegible
scrawl seemed out of place and alien. And there
was, too, something mysterious and slightly furtive about it. A thin sly thing which bore no
return address to betray the sender. Not that
she hadn’t immediately known who its sender
was. Some two years ago she had one very like
it in outward appearance. Furtive, but yet in
some peculiar, determined way a little flaunting. Purple ink. Foreign paper of extraordinary
size.</p>
<p>It had been, Irene noted, postmarked in
New York the day before. Her brows came together in a tiny frown. The frown, however,
was more from perplexity than from annoyance; though there was in her thoughts an element of both. She was wholly unable to compre hend such an attitude towards danger as she was
sure the letter’s contents would reveal; and she
disliked the idea of opening and reading it.</p>
<p>This, she reflected, was of a piece with
all that she knew of Clare Kendry. Stepping always on the edge of danger. Always aware, but
not drawing back or turning aside. Certainly
not because of any alarms or feeling of outrage
on the part of others.</p>
<p>And for a swift moment Irene Redfield
seemed to see a pale small girl sitting on a
ragged blue sofa, sewing pieces of bright red
cloth together, while her drunken father, a
tall, powerfully built man, raged threateningly
up and down the shabby room, bellowing
curses and making spasmodic lunges at her
which were not the less frightening because
they were, for the most part. Ineffectual. Sometimes he did manage to reach her. But only
the fact that the child had edged herself and
her poor sewing over to the farthermost corner of the sofa suggested that she was in any
way perturbed by this menace to herself and
her work.</p>
<p>Clare had known well enough that it
was unsafe to take a portion of the dollar that
was her weekly wage for the doing of many
errands for the dressmaker who lived on the
top floor of the building of which Bob Kendry
was janitor. But that knowledge had not deterred her. She wanted to go to her Sunday
school’s picnic, and she had made up her mind
to wear a new dress. So, In spite of certain unpleasantness and possible danger, she had
taken the money to buy the material for that
pathetic little red frock.</p>
<p>There had been, even In those days,
nothing sacrificial In Clare Kendry’s Idea of
life, no allegiance beyond her own Immediate
desire. She was selfish, and cold, and hard. And
yet she had, too, a strange capacity of transforming warmth and passion, verging sometimes almost on theatrical heroics.</p>
<p>Irene, who was a year or more older
than Clare, remembered the day that Bob Kendry had been brought home dead, killed in
a silly saloon-fight. Clare, who was at that
time a scant fifteen years old, had just stood
there with her lips pressed together, her thin
arms folded across her narrow chest, staring
down at the familiar pasty-white face of her
parent with a sort of disdain in her slanting
black eyes. For a very long time she had stood
like that, silent and staring. Then, quite suddenly, she had given way to a torrent of weeping, swaying her thin body, tearing at her
bright hair, and stamping her small feet. The
outburst had ceased as suddenly as it had begun. She glanced quickly about the bare room,
taking everyone in, even the two policemen, in
a sharp look of flashing scorn. And, in the next
instant, she had turned and vanished through
the door.</p>
<p>Seen across the long stretch of years,
the thing had more the appearance of an outpouring of pent-up fury than of an overflow of
grief for her dead father; though she had been,
Irene admitted, fond enough of him In her own
rather catlike way.</p>
<p>Catlike. Certainly that was the word
which best described Clare Kendry, if any single word could  describe her. pometlmes she
was hard and apparently without feeling at all;
sometimes she was affectionate and rashly Impulsive. And there was about her an amazing
soft malice, hidden well away until provoked.
Then she was capable of scratching, and very
effectively too. Or, driven to anger, she would
fight with a ferocity and impetuousness that
disregarded or forgot any danger; superior
strength, numbers, or other unfavourable circumstances. How savagely she had clawed
those boys the day they had hooted her parent
and sung a derisive rhyme, of their own composing, which pointed out certain eccentricities
in his careening gait! And how deliberately
she had —</p>
<p>Irene brought her thoughts back to the
present, to the letter from Clare Kendry that
she still held unopened in her hand. With a little feeling of apprehension, she very slowly cut
the envelope, drew out the folded sheets, spread
them, and began to read.</p>
<p>It was, she saw at once, what she had
expected since learning from the postmark
that Clare was in the city. An extravagantly
phrased wish to see her again. Well, she
needn’t and wouldn’t, Irene told herself, accede to that. Nor would she assist Clare to
realize her foolish desire to return for a moment to that life which long ago, and of her
own choice, she had left behind her.</p>
<p>She ran through the letter, puzzling
out, as best she could, the carelessly formed
words or making instinctive guesses at them.</p>
<p>“… For I am lonely, so lonely …
cannot help longing to be with you again, as I
have never longed for anything before; and I
have wanted many things in my life… . You
can’t know how in this pale life of mine I am
all the time seeing the bright pictures of that
other that I once thought I was glad to be free
of… . It’s like an ache, a pain that never
ceases… .” Sheets upon thin sheets of it.
And ending finally with, “and it’s your fault,
‘Rene dear. At least partly. For I wouldn’t
now, perhaps, have this terrible, this wild desire if I hadn’t seen you that time in Chicago… .”
Brilliant red patches flamed in Irene
Redfield’s warm olive cheeks.</p>
<p>“That time in Chicago.” The words
stood out from among the many paragraphs of
other words, bringing with them a clear, sharp
remembrance, in which even now, after two
years, humiliation, resentment, and rage were
mingled.</p>
