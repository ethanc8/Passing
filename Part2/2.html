<p>Five days had gone by since Clare Kendry’s
appealing letter. Irene Redfield had not replied
to it. Nor had she had any other word from
Clare.</p>
<p>She had not carried out her first intention of writing at once because on going back
to the letter for Clare’s address, she had come
upon something which, in the rigour of her determination to maintain unbroken between them
the wall that Clare herself had raised, she had
forgotten, or not fully noted. It was the fact
that Clare had requested her to direct her answer to the post office’s general delivery.</p>
<p>That had angered Irene, and increased
her disdain and contempt for the other.</p>
<p>Tearing the letter across, she had flung
it into the ‘ scrap-basket. It wasn’t so much
Clare’s carefulness and her desire for secrecy in
their relations — Irene understood the need for
that — as that Clare should have doubted her
discretion, implied that she might not be cau tious in the wording of her reply and the choice
of a posting-box. Having always had complete
confidence in her own good judgment and tact,
Irene couldn’t bear to have anyone seem to
question them. Certainly not Clare Kendry.</p>
<p>In another, calmer moment she decided
that It was, after all, better to answer nothing,
to explain nothing, to refuse nothing; to dispose of the matter simply by not writing at all.
Clare, of whom it couldn’t be said that she
was stupid, would not mistake the imphcation
of that silence. She might — and Irene was sure
that she would — choose to ignore it and write
again, but that didn’t matter. The whole thing
would be very easy. The basket for all letters,
silence for their answers.</p>
<p>Most likely she and Clare would never
meet again. Well, she, for one, could endure
that. Since childhood their lives had never really
touched. Actually they were strangers. Strangers in their ways and means of living. Strangers in their desires and ambitions. Strangers
even in their racial consciousness. Between them
the barrier was just as high, just as broad, and
just as firm as If in Clare did not run that strain
of black blood. In truth, it was higher, broader,
and firmer; because for her there were perils,
not known, or imagined, by those others who
had no such secrets to alarm or endanger them.</p>
<p>The day was getting on toward evening.
It was past the middle of October. There had
been a week of cold rain, drenching the rotting
leaves which had fallen from the poor trees
that lined the street on which the Redfields’
house was located, and sending a damp air of
penetrating chill into the house, with a hint of
cold days to come. In Irene’s room a low fire
was burning. Outside, only a dull grey light was
left of the day. Inside, lamps had already been
lighted.</p>
<p>From the floor above there was the
sound of young voices. Sometimes Junior’s serious and positive; again, Ted’s deceptively gracious one. Often there was laughter, or the
noise of commotion, tussling, or toys being
slammed down.</p>
<p>Junior, tall for his age, was almost in-  credibly like his father in feature and colouring; but his temperament was hers, practical
and determined, rather than Brian’s. Ted,
speculative and withdrawn, was, apparently,
less positive in his ideas and desires. About him
there was a deceiving air of candour that was,
Irene knew, like his father’s show of reasonable acquiescence. If, for the time being, and
with a charming appearance of artlessness, he
submitted to the force of superior strength, or
some other immovable condition or circumstance, it was because of his intense dislike of
scenes and unpleasant argument. Brian over
again.</p>
<p>Gradually Irene’s thought slipped away
from Junior and Ted, to become wholly absorbed in their father.</p>
<p>The old fear, with strength increased,
the fear for the future, had again laid its hand
on her. And, try as she might, she could not
shake it off. It was as if she had admitted to
herself that against that easy surface of her
husband’s concordance with her wishes, which
had, since the war had given him back to her
physically unimpaired, covered an Increasing
Inclination to tear himself and his possessions
loose from their proper setting, she was helpless.</p>
<p>The chagrin which she had felt at her
first failure to subvert this latest manifestation
of his discontent had receded, leaving In Its
wake an uneasy depression. Were all her efforts,
all her labours, to make up to him that one loss,
all her silent striving to prove to him that her
way had been best, all her ministrations to him,
all her outward sinking of self, to count for
nothing In some unpercelved sudden moment?
And If so, what, then, would be the consequences to the boys? To her? To Brian himself? Endless searching had brought no answer
to these questions. There was only an Intense
weariness from their shuttle-like procession In
her brain.</p>
<p>The noise and commotion from above
grew Increasingly louder. Irene was about to go
to the stairway and request the boys to be
quieter In their play when she heard the doorbell ringing.
Now, who was that likely to be? She
listened to Zulena’s heels, faintly tapping on
their way to the door, then to the shifting sound
of her feet on the steps, then to her light knock
on the bedroom door.</p>
<p>“Yes. Come In,” Irene told her.</p>
<p>Zulena stood In the doorway. She said:
“Someone to see you, Mrs. Redfield.” Her
tone was discreetly regretful, as If to convey
that she was reluctant to disturb her mistress
at that hour, and for a stranger. “A Mrs. Bellew.”</p>
<p>Clare I</p>
<p>‘’Oh dear! Tell her, Zulena,” Irene began, “that I can’t — No. I’ll see her. Please
bring her up here.”</p>
<p>She heard Zulena pass down the hall,
down the stairs, then stood up, smoothing out
the tumbled green and Ivory draperies of her
dress with light stroking pats. At the mirror
she dusted a little powder on her nose and
brushed out her hair.</p>
<p>She meant to tell Clare Kendry at once,
and definitely, that It was of no use, her com ing, that she couldn’t be responsible, that she’d
talked it over with Brian, who had agreed with
her that it was wiser, for Clare’s own sake, to
refrain —</p>
<p>But that was as far as she got in her
rehearsal. For Clare had come softly into the
room without knocking, and before Irene could
greet her, had dropped a kiss on her dark
curls.</p>
<p>Looking at the woman before her, Irene
Redfield had a sudden inexplicable onrush of
affectionate feeling. Reaching out, she grasped
Clare’s two hand in her own and cried with
something like awe in her voice: “Dear God!
But aren’t you lovely, Clare!”</p>
<p>Clare tossed that aside. Like the furs
and small blue hat which she threw on the bed
before seating herself slantwise in Irene’s favourite chair, with one foot curled under her.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you mern to answer my letter,
*Rene?” she asked gravely.</p>
<p>Irene looked away. She had that uncomfortable feeling that one has when one has
not been wholly kind or wholly true.
Clare went on: ‘’Every day I went to
that nasty little post-office place. I’m sure they
were all beginning to think that I’d been carrying on an illicit love-affair and that the man had
thrown me over. Every morning the same answer: ‘Nothing for you.’ I got into an awful
fright, thinking that something might have
happened to your letter, or to mine. And half
the nights I would lie awake looking out at
the watery stars — hopeless things, the stars —
worrying and wondering. But at last it soaked
in, that you hadn’t written and didn’t Intend
to. And then — well, as soon as ever I’d seen
Jack off for Florida, I came straight here. And
now, ‘Rene, please tell me quite frankly why
you didn’t answer my letter.”</p>
<p>“Because, you see — “ Irene broke off
and kept Clare waiting while she lit a cigarette,
blew out the match, and dropped it Into a tray.
She was trying to collect her arguments, for
some sixth sense warned her that It was going
to be harder than she thought to convince Clare
Kendry of the folly of Harlem for her. Finally
she proceeded: “I can’t help thinking that you
ought not to come up here, ought not to run
the risk of knowing Negroes.”</p>
<p>“You mean you don’t want me, ‘Rene?”</p>
<p>Irene hadn’t supposed that anyone could
look so hurt. She said, quite gently, “No, Clare,
it’s not that. But even you must see that it’s
terribly foolish, and not just the right thing.”</p>
<p>The tinkle of Clare’s laugh rang out,
while she passed her hands over the bright
sweep of her hair. “Oh, ‘Rene!” she cried,
“you’re priceless ! And you haven’t changed a
bit. The right thing!” Leaning forward, she
looked curiously into Irene’s disapproving
brown eyes. “You don’t, you really can’t mean
exactly that! Nobody could. It’s simply unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Irene was on her feet before she realized that she had risen. “What I really mean,”
she retorted, “is that it’s dangerous and that
you ought not to run such silly risks. No one
ought to. You least of all.”</p>
<p>Her voice was brittle. For into her
mind had come a thought, strange and irrelevant,  a  suspicion,  that  had  surprised  and
shocked her and driven her to her feet. It was
that in spite of her determined selfishness the
woman before her was yet capable of heights
and depths of feeling that she, Irene Redfield,
had never known. Indeed, never cared to know.
The thought, the suspicion, was gone as quickly
as it had come.</p>
<p>Clare said: “Oh, me!”
/     Irene touched her arm caressingly, as if
in contrition for that flashing thought. “Yes,
Clare, you. It’s not safe. Not safe at all.”</p>
<p>“Safe!”</p>
<p>It seemed to Irene that Clare had
snapped her teeth down on the word and then
flung It from her. And for another flying second she had that suspicion of Clare’s ability for
a quality of feeling that was to her strange, and
even repugnant. She was aware, too, of a dim
premonition of some impending disaster. It was
as If Clare Kendry had said to her, for whom
safety, security, were all-important: “Safe!
Damn being safe!” and meant it.</p>
<p>With a gesture of impatience she sat
down. In a voice of cool formality, she said:
‘’Brian and I have talked the whole thing over
carefully and decided that it isn’t wise. He
says it’s always a dangerous business, this coming back. He’s seen more than one come to
grief because of it. And, Clare, considering
everything — Mr. Bellew’s attitude and all that
— don’t you think you ought to be as careful as
you can?”</p>
<p>Clare’s deep voice broke the small silence that had followed Irene’s speech. She
said, speaking almost plaintively: “I ought to
have known. It’s Jack. I don’t blame you for
being angry, though I must say you behaved
beautifully that day. But I did think you’d
understand, ‘Rene. It was that, partly, that has
made me want to see other people. It just
swooped down and changed everything. If it
hadn’t been for that, I’d have gone on to the
end, never seeing any of you. But that did
something to me, and I’ve been so lonely since!
You can’t know. Not close to a single soul.
Never anyone to really talk to.”</p>
<p>Irene pressed out her cigarette. While
doing so, she saw again the vision of Clare
Kendry staring disdainfully down at the face of
her father, and thought that it would be like
that that she would look at her husband if he
lay dead before her.</p>
<p>Her own resentment was swept aside
and her voice held an accent of pity as she exclaimed: “Why, Clare! I didn’t know. Forgive me. I feel like seven beasts. It was stupid
of me not to realize.”</p>
<p>“No. Not at all. You couldn’t. Nobody,
none of you, could,” Clare moaned. The black
eyes filled with tears that ran down her cheeks
and spilled into her lap, ruining the priceless
velvet of her dress. Her long hands were a little
uplifted and clasped tightly together. Her effort to speak moderately was obvious, but not
successful. “How could you know? How could ‘
you? You’re free. You’re happy. And,” with
faint derision, “safe.”</p>
<p>Irene passed over that touch of derision, for the poignant rebellion of the other’s
words had brought the tears to her own eyes,
though she didn’t allow them to fall. The truth
was that she knew weeping did not become her.
Few women, she imagined, wept as attractively
as Clare. I”Tm beginning to believe,” she murmured, “that no one is ever completely happy,
or free, or safe.” )</p>
<p>“Well, tfien, what does it matter? One
risk more or less, if we’re not safe anyway, if
even you’re not, it can’t make all the difference
in the world. It can’t to me. Besides, I’m used
to risks. And this isn’t such a big one as you’re
trying to make it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but it is. And it can make all the
difference in the world. There’s your little girl,
Clare. Think of the consequences to her.”</p>
<p>Clare’s face took on a startled look, as
though she were totally unprepared for this
new weapon with which Irene had assailed her.
Seconds passed, during which she sat with
stricken eyes and compressed lips. “I think,”
she said at last, “that being a mother is the
cruellest thing in the world.” Her clasped hands
swayed forward and back again, and her scarlet
mouth trembled irrepressibly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Irene softly agreed. For a moment she was unable to say more, so accurately
had Clare put into words that which, not so
definitely defined, was so often in her own heart
of late. At the same time she was conscious that
here, to her hand, was a reason which could not
be lightly brushed aside. “Yes,” she repeated,
“and the most responsible, Clare. We mothers
are all responsible for the security and happiness of our children. Think what it would mean
to your Margery if Mr. Bellew should find out.
You’d probably lose her. And even if you
didn’t, nothing that concerned her would ever
be the same again. He’d never forget that she
had Negro blood. And if she should learn —
Well, I believe that after twelve it is too late
to learn a thing like that. She’d never forgive
you. You may be used to risks, but this is one
you mustn’t take, Clare. It’s a selfish whim, an
unnecessary and —</p>
<p>“Yes, Zulena, what is it?” she inquired,
a trifle tartly, of the servant who had silently
materialized in the doorway.</p>
<p>“The telephone’s for you, Mrs. Redfield. It’s Mr. Wentworth.”</p>
<p>“All  right.  Thank  you.  I’ll  take  it
here.” And, with a muttered apology to Clare,
she took up the Instrument.</p>
<p>“Hello… . Yes, Hugh. … Oh,
quite… . And you? … I’m sorry, every
single thing’s gone… . Oh, too bad… .
Ye-es, I s’pose you could. Not very pleasant,
though… . Yes, of course. In a pinch everything goes… . Walt! I’ve got It! I’ll change
mine with whoever’s next to you, and you can
have that… . No. … I mean It… .
I’ll be so busy I shan’t know whether I’m sitting or standing. … As long as Brian has a
place to drop down now and then… . Not a
single soul… . No, don’t. ., . . That’s
nice… . My love to Blanca… . I’ll see
to It right away and call you back… . Goodbye.”</p>
<p>She hung up and turned back to Clare, a
little frown on her softly chiselled features.
“It’s the N. W. L. dance,” she explained, “the
Negro Welfare League, you know. I’m on the
ticket committee, or, rather, I am the committee. Thank heaven It comes off tomorrow
night and doesn’t happen again for a year. I’m
about crazy,  and now I’ve  got to persuade
somebody to change boxes with me.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t,” Clare asked, “Hugh
Wentworth? Not the Hugh Wentworth?”</p>
<p>Irene incHned her head. On her face
was a tiny triumphant smile. “Yes, the Hugh
Wentworth. D’you know him?”</p>
<p>“No. How should I? But I do know
about him. And I’ve read a book or two of
his.”</p>
<p>“Awfully good, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“U-umm, I s’pose so. Sort of contemptuous, I thought. As if he more or less despised
everything and everybody.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he did.
Still, he’s about earned the right to. Lived on
the edges of nowhere in at least three continents. Been through every danger in all kinds
of savage places. It’s no wonder he thinks the
rest of us are a lazy self-pampering lot. Hugh’s
a dear, though, generous as one of the twelve
disciples ; give you the shirt off his back. Bianca
— that’s his wife — is nice too.”
“And he’s coming up here to your
dance?”</p>
<p>Irene asked why not.</p>
<p>“It seems rather curious, a man like
that, going to a Negro dance.”</p>
<p>This, Irene told her, was the year 1927
in the city of New York, and hundreds of
white people of Hugh Wentworth’s type came
to affairs in Harlem, more all the time. So
many that Brian had said: “Pretty soon the
coloured people won’t be allowed in at all, or
will have to sit in Jim Crowed sections.”</p>
<p>“What do they come for?”</p>
<p>“Same reason you’re here, to see Negroes.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>“Various motives,” Irene explained. “A
few purely and frankly to enjoy themselves.
Others to get material to turn into shekels.
More, to gaze on these great and near great
while they gaze on the Negroes.”</p>
<p>Clare clapped her hand. “ ‘Rene, suppose I come too ! It sounds terribly Interesting
and amusing. And I don’t see why I shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Irene, who was regarding her through
narrowed eyelids, had the same thought that
she had had two years ago on the roof of the
Drayton, that Clare Kendry was just a shade
too good-looking. Her tone was on the edge of
irony as she said: “You mean because so many
other white people go?”</p>
<p>A pale rose-colour came Into Clare’s
ivory cheeks. She lifted a hand In protest.
“Don’t be silly! Certainly not! I mean that in
a crowd of that kind I shouldn’t be noticed.”</p>
<p>On the contrary, was Irene’s opinion.
It might be even doubly dangerous. Some friend
or acquaintance of John Bellew or herself
might see and recognize her.</p>
<p>At that, Clare laughed for a long time,
little musical trills following one another in
sequence after sequence. It was as if the
thought of any friend of John Bellew’s going
to a Negro dance was to her the most amusing
thing in the world.</p>
<p>“I don’t think,” she said, when she had
done laughing, “we need worry about that.”</p>
<p>“ / ^y Irene, however, wasn’t so sure. But all
her efforts to dissuade Clare were useless. To
her, “You never can tell whom you’re likely to
meet there,” Clare’s rejoinder was: “I’ll take
my chance on getting by.”</p>
<p>“Besides, you won’t know a soul and I
shall be too busy to look after you. You’ll be
bored stiff.”</p>
<p>“I won’t, I won’t. If nobody asks me to
dance, not even Dr. Redfield, I’ll just sit and
gaze on the great and the near great, too. Do,
‘Rene, be polite and invite me.”</p>
<p>Irene turned away from the caress of
Clare’s smile, saying promptly and positively:
“I will not.”</p>
<p>“I mean to go anyway,” Clare retorted,
and her voice was no less positive than Irene’s.</p>
<p>“Oh, no. You couldn’t possibly go there
alone. It’s a public thing. All sorts of people
go, anybody who can pay a dollar, even ladies
of easy virtue looking for trade. If you were
to go there alone, you might be mistaken for
one of them, and that wouldn’t be too pleas</p>
<p>ant.”</p>
<p>Clare laughed again. “Thanks. I never
have been. It might be amusing. I’m warning
you, ‘Rene, that if you’re not going to be nice
and take me, I’ll still be among those present.
I suppose, my dollar’s as good as anyone’s.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the dollar! Don’t be a fool,
Claire. I don’t care where you go, or what you
do. All I’m concerned with is the unpleasantness and possible danger which your going
might incur, because of your situation. To put
it frankly, I shouldn’t like to be mixed up in
any row of the kind.” She had risen again as
she spoke and was standing at the window
lifting and spreading the small yellow chrysanthemums in the grey stone jar on the sill. Her
hands shook slightly, for she was in a near
rage of impatience and exasperation.</p>
<p>Claire’s face looked strange, as if she
wanted to cry again. One of her satin-covered
feet swung restlessly back and forth. She said
vehemently, violently almost: “Damn Jack!
He keeps me out of everything. Everything I
want. I could kill him ! I expect I shall, some
day.”
“I wouldn’t,” Irene advised her, “you
see, there’s still capital punishment, In this state
at least. And really, Clare, after everything’s
said, I can’t see that you’ve a right to put all the
blame on him. You’ve got to admit that there’s
his side to the thing. You didn’t tell him you
were coloured, so he’s got no way of knowing
about this hankering of yours after Negroes,
or that It galls you to fury to hear them called
niggers and black devils. As far as I can see,
you’ll just have to endure some things and give
up others. As we’ve said before, everything
must be paid for. Do, please, be reasonable.”</p>
<p>But Clare, It was plain, had shut away
reason as well as caution. She shook her head.
“I can’t, I can’t,” she said. “I would If I could,
but I can’t. You don’t know, you can’t realize
how I want to see Negroes, to be with them
again, to talk with them, to hear them laugh.”</p>
<p>And In the look she gave Irene, there
was something groping, and hopeless, and yet
so absolutely determined that It was like an
Image of the futile searching and the firm resolution In Irene’s own soul, and Increased the
feeling of doubt and compunction that had
been growing within her about Clare Kendry.</p>
<p>She gave in.</p>
<p>“Oh, come if you want to. I s’pose
you’re right. Once can’t do such a terrible lot
of harm.”</p>
<p>Pushing aside Clare’s extravagant
thanks, for immediately she was sorry that she
had consented, she said briskly: “Should you
like to come up and see my boys?”</p>
<p>“I’d love to.”</p>
<p>They went up, Irene thinking that Brian
would consider that she’d behaved like a spineless fool. And he would be right. She certainly
had.</p>
<p>Clare was smiling. She stood in the
doorway of the boys’ playroom, her shadowy
eyes looking down on Junior and Ted, who had
sprung apart from their tusselling. Junior’s face
had a funny little look of resentment. Ted’s
was blank.</p>
<p>Clare said: “Please don’t be cross. Of
course, I know I’ve gone and spoiled every thing. But maybe, If I promise not to get too
much in the way, you’ll let me come in, just
the same.”</p>
<p>“Sure, come in if you want to,” Ted told
her. “We can’t stop you, you know.” He
smiled and made her a little bow and then
turned away to a shelf that held his favourite
books. Taking one down, he settled himself in
a chair and began to read.</p>
<p>Junior said nothing, did nothing, merely
stood there waiting.</p>
<p>“Get up, Ted! That’s rude. This is
Theodore, Mrs. Bellew. Please excuse his bad
manners. He does know better. And this is
Brian junior. Mrs. Bellew is an old friend of
mother’s. We used to play together when we
were little girls.”</p>
<p>Clare had gone and Brian had telephoned that he’d been detained and would have
his dinner downtown. Irene was a little glad
for that. She was going out later herself, and
that meant she wouldn’t, probably, see Brian
until morning and so could put off for a few
more hours speaking of Clare and the N. W. L.
dance.</p>
<p>She was angry with herself and with
Clare. But more with herself, for having permitted Clare to tease her Into doing something
that Brian had, all but expressly, asked her not
to do. She didn’t want him ruffled, not just
then, not while he was possessed of that unreasonable restless feeling.</p>
<p>She was annoyed, too, because she was
aware that she had consented to something
which, if It went beyond the dance, would Involve her In numerous petty inconveniences and
evasions. And not only at home with Brian, but
outside with friends and acquaintances. The disagreeable possibilities in connection with Clare
Kendry’s coming among them loomed before
her In endless irritating array.</p>
<p>Clare, It seemed, still retained her ability to secure the thing that she wanted in the
face of any opposition, and in utter disregard
of the convenience and desire of others. About
her there was some quality, hard and persistent,
with the strength and endurance of rock, that
would not be beaten or ignored. She couldn’t,
Irene thought, have had an entirely serene life.
Not with that dark secret for ever crouching
in the background of her consciousness. And
yet she hadn’t the air of a woman whose life
had been touched by uncertainty or suffering.
Pain, fear, and grief were things that left their
mark on people. Even love, that exquisite torturing emotion, left its subtle traces on the
countenance.</p>
<p>But Clare — she had remained almost
what she had always been, an attractive, somewhat lonely child — selfish, wilful, and disturbing.</p>
