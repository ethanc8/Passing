<p>But undistinctive as the dance had seemed,
it was, nevertheless, Important. For It marked
the beginning of a new factor In Irene Redfield’s
life, something that left its trace on all
the future years of her existence. It was the
beginning of a new friendship with Clare Kendry.</p>
<p>She came to them frequently after that.
Always with a touching gladness that welled
up and overflowed on all the Redfield household. Yet Irene could never be sure whether
her comings were a joy or a vexation.</p>
<p>Certainly she was no trouble. She had
not to be entertained, or even noticed — if anyone could ever avoid noticing Clare. If Irene
happened to be out or occupied, Clare could
very happily amuse herself with Ted and
Junior, who had conceived for her an admiration that verged on adoration, especially Ted.
Or, lacking the boys, she would descend to the
kitchen and, with — to Irene — an exasperating
childlike lack of perception, spend her visit in
talk and merriment with Zulena and Sadie.</p>
<p>Irene, while secretly resenting these
visits to the playroom and kitchen, for some obscure reason which she shied away from putting
into words, never requested that Clare make an
end of them, or hinted that she wouldn’t have
spoiled her own Margery so outrageously, nor
been so friendly with white servants.</p>
<p>Brian looked on these things with the
same tolerant amusement that marked his entire
attitude toward Clare. Never since his faintly
derisive surprise at Irene’s information that
she was to go with them the night of the dance,
had he shown any disapproval of Clare’s presence. On the other hand, it couldn’t be said
that her presence seemed to please him. It
didn’t annoy or disturb him, so far as Irene
could judge. That was all.</p>
<p>Didn’t he, she once asked him, think
Clare was extraordinarily beautiful?</p>
<p>“No,” he had answered. “That is, not
particularly.”</p>
<p>“Brian, you’re fooling!”
“No, honestly. Maybe Fm fussy. I
s’pose she’d be an unusually good-looking white
woman. I like my ladies darker. Beside an Anumber-one sheba, she simply hasn’t got ‘em.”</p>
<p>Clare went, sometimes with Irene and
Brian, to parties and dances, and on a few
occasions when Irene hadn’t been able or inclined to go out, she had gone alone with Brian
to some bridge party or benefit dance.</p>
<p>Once in a while she came formally to
dine with them. She wasn’t, however, in spite
of her poise and air of worldliness, the ideal
dinner-party guest. Beyond the aesthetic pleasure one got from watching her, she contributed
little, sitting for the most part silent, an odd
dreaming look in her hypnotic eyes. Though she
could for some purpose of her own — the desire
to be included in some party being made up to
go cabareting, or an invitation to a dance or a
tea — talk fluently and entertainingly.</p>
<p>She was generally liked. She was so
friendly and responsive, and so ready to press
the sweet food of flattery on all. Nor did she
object to appearing a bit pathetic and ill-used,
SO that people could feel sorry for her. And, no
matter how often she came among them, she
still remained someone apart, a little mysterious and strange, someone to wonder about and
to admire and to pity.</p>
<p>Her visits were undecided and uncertain, being, as they were, dependent on the
presence or absence of John Bellew in the city.
But she did, once in a while, manage to steal
uptown for an afternoon even when he was not
away. As time went on without any apparent
danger of discovery, even Irene ceased to be
perturbed about the possibiHty of Clare’s husband’s stumbling on her racial identity.</p>
<p>The daughter, Margery, had been left
in Switzerland in school, for Clare and Bellew
would be going back in the early spring. In
March, Clare thought. “And how I do hate to
think of it!” she would say, always with a suggestion of leashed rebellion; “but I can’t see
how I’m going to get out of it. Jack won’t
hear of my staying behind. If I could have just
a couple of months more in New York, alone I
mean, I’d be the happiest thing in the world.”
“I Imagine you’ll be happy enough, once
you get away,” Irene told her one day when
she was bewailing her approaching departure.
“Remember, there’s Margery. Think how
glad you’ll be to see her after all this time.”</p>
<p>“Children aren’t everything,” was Clare
Kendry’s answer to that. “There are other
things in the world, though I admit some people don’t seem to suspect It.” And she laughed,
more. It seemed, at some secret joke of her own
than at her words.</p>
<p>Irene replied: “You know you don’t
mean that, Clare. You’re only trying to tease
me. I know very well that I take being a mother
rather seriously, I am wrapped up in my boys
and the running of my house. I can’t help It.
And, really, I don’t think it’s anything to laugh
at.” And though she was aware of the slight
primness in her words and attitude, she had
neither power nor wish to efface it.</p>
<p>Clare, suddenly very sober and sweet,
said: “You’re right. It’s no laughing matter.
It’s shameful of me to tease you, ‘Rene. You are
so good.” And she reached out and gave Irene’s
hand an affectionate little squeeze. “Don’t
think,” she added, ^Vhatever happens, that
I’ll ever forget how good you’ve been to me.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!”</p>
<p>“Oh, but you have, you have. It’s just
that I haven’t any proper morals or sense of
duty, as you have, that makes me act as I do.”</p>
<p>“Now you are talking nonsense.”</p>
<p>“But it’s true, ‘Rene. Can’t you realize
that I’m not like you a bit? Why, to get the
things I want badly enough, I’d do anything,
hurt anybody, throw anything away. Really,
‘Rene, I’m not safe.” Her voice as well as the
look on her face had a beseeching earnestness
that made Irene vaguely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She said: “I don’t believe it. In the first
place what you’re saying is so utterly, so
wickedly wrong. And as for your giving up
things — “ She stopped, at a loss for an acceptable term to express her opinion of Clare’s
“having” nature.</p>
<p>But Clare Kendry had begun to cry,
audibly, with no effort at restraint, and for no
reason that Irene could discover.</p>
