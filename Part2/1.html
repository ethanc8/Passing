<p>StJCH WERE Irene Redfield’s memories as she
sat there in her room, a flood of October sunlight streaming in upon her, holding that second letter of Clare Kendry’s.</p>
<p>Laying it aside, she regarded with an astonishment that had in it a mild degree of
amusement the violence of the feelings which it
stirred in her.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the great measure of anger
that surprised and slightly amused her. That,
she was certain, was justified and reasonable,
as was the fact that it could hold, still strong
and unabated, across the stretch of two years’
time entirely removed from any sight or sound
of John Bellew, or of Clare. That even at this
remote date the memory of the man’s words
and manner had power to set her hands to
trembling and to send the blood pounding
against her temples did not seem to her extraordinary. But that she should retain that dim
sense   of   fear,   of  panic,   was   surprising,
silly.</p>
<p>That Clare should have written, should,
even all things considered, have expressed a
desire to see her again, did not so much amaze
her. To count as nothing the annoyances, the
bitterness, or the suffering of others, that was
Clare.</p>
<p>Well — Irene’s shoulders went up — one
thing was sure : that she needn’t, and didn’t
intend to, lay herself open to any repetition of
a humiliation as galling and outrageous as that
which, for Clare Kendry’s sake, she had borne
“that time in Chicago.” Once was enough.</p>
<p>If, at the time of choosing, Clare hadn’t
precisely reckoned the cost, she had, nevertheless, no right to expect others to help make
up the reckoning. The trouble with Clare was,
not only that she wanted to have her cake and
eat it too, but that she wanted to nibble at the
cakes of other folk as well.</p>
<p>Irene Redfield found it hard to sympathize with this new tenderness, this avowed
yearning of Clare’s for “my own people.”
The letter which she just put out of her
hand was, to her taste, a bit too lavish in its
wordiness, a shade too unreserved in the manner of its expression. It roused again that old
suspicion that Clare was acting, not consciously,
perhaps — that is, not too consciously — but,
none the less, acting. Nor was Irene inclined
to excuse what she termed Clare’s downright
selfishness.</p>
<p>And mingled with her disbelief and resentment was another feeling, a question. Why
hadn’t she spoken that day? Why, in the face
of Bellew’s ignorant hate and aversion, had
she concealed her own origin? Why had she
allowed him to make his assertions and express
his misconceptions undisputed? Why, simply
because of Clare Kendry, who had exposed her
to such torment, had she failed to take up the
defence of the race to which she belonged?</p>
<p>Irene asked these questions, felt them.
They were, however, merely rhetorical, as she
herself was well aware. She knew their answers, every one, and it was the same for them
all.  The sardony of it!  She couldn’t betray
Clare, couldn’t even run the risk of appearing
to defend a people that were being maligned,
for fear that that defence might in some infinitesimal degree lead the way to final discovery of
her secret. She had to Clare Kendry a duty. She
was bound to her by those very ties of race,
which, for all her repudiation of them, Clare
had been unable to completely sever.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t, as Irene knew, that Clare
cared at all about the race or what was to become of it. She didn’t. Or that she had for any
of its members great, or even real, affection,
though she professed undying gratitude for the
small kindnesses which the Westover family
had shown her when she was a child. Irene
doubted the genuineness of it, seeing herself
only as a means to an end where Clare was
concerned. Nor could it be said that she had
even the slight artistic or sociological interest
In the race that some members of other races
displayed. She hadn’t. No, Clare Kendry cared
nothing for the race. She only belonged to It.</p>
<p>“Not another damned thing!” Irene de-  clared aloud as she drew a fragile stocking
over a pale beige-coloured foot.</p>
<p>“Aha ! Swearing again, are you, madam ?
Caught you in the act that time.”</p>
<p>Brian Redfield had come into the room
in that noiseless way which, in spite, of the
years of their life together, still had the power
to disconcert her. He stood looking down on
her with that amused smile of his, which was
just the faintest bit supercilious and yet was
somehow very becoming to him.</p>
<p>Hastily Irene pulled on the other stocking and slipped her feet into the slippers beside
her chair.</p>
<p>“And what brought on this particular
outburst of profanity? That is, if an indulgent
but perturbed husband may inquire. The mother
of sons too ! The times, alas, the times!”</p>
<p>“I’ve had this letter,” Irene told him.
“And I’m sure that anybody’ll admit it’s enough
to make a saint swear. The nerve of her!”</p>
<p>She passed the letter to him, and in
the act made a little mental frown. For, with
a nicety of perception, she saw that she was
doing it Instead of answering his question with
words, so that he might be occupied while she
hurried through her dressing. For she was late
again, and Brian, she well knew, detested that.
Why, oh why, couldn’t she ever manage to be
on time? Brian had been up for ages, had made
some calls for all she knew, besides having
taken the boys downtown to school. And she
wasn’t dressed yet; had only begun. Damn
Clare ! This morning it was her fault.</p>
<p>Brian sat down and bent his head over
the letter, puckering his brows slightly in his
effort to make out Clare’s scrawl.</p>
<p>Irene, who had risen and was standing
before the mirror, ran a comb through her
black hair, then tossed her head with a light
characteristic gesture. In order to disarrange a
little the set locks. She touched a powder-puff
to her warm olive skin, and then put on her
frock with a motion so hasty that It was with
some difficulty properly adjusted. At last she
was ready, though she didn’t Immediately say
so, but stood, Instead, looking with a sort of
curious detachment at her husband across the
room.</p>
<p>Brian, she was thinking, was extremely
good-looking. Not, of course, pretty or effeminate; the slight irregularity of his nose saved
him from the prettiness, and the rather marked
heaviness of his chin saved him from the effeminacy. But he was, in a pleasant masculine
way, rather handsome. And yet, wouldn’t he,
perhaps, have been merely ordinarily goodlooking but for the richness, the beauty of his
skin, which was of an exquisitely fine texture
and deep copper colour.</p>
<p>He looked up and said: “Clare? That
must be the girl you told me about meeting the
last time you were out home. The one you
went to tea with?”</p>
<p>Irene’s answer to that was an inclination of the head.</p>
<p>“I’m ready,” she said.</p>
<p>They were going downstairs, Brian
deftly, unnecessarily, piloting her round the
two short curved steps, just before the centre
landing.
“You’re not,” he asked, “going to see
her?”</p>
<p>His words, however, were In reality not
a question, but, as Irene was aware, an admonition.</p>
<p>Her front teeth just touched. She spoke
through them, and her tones held a thin sarcasm. “Brian, darling, I’m really not such an,
idiot that I don’t realize that if a man calls me
a nigger, it’s his fault the first time, but mine
if he has the opportunity to do It again.”</p>
<p>They went Into the dining-room. He
drew back her chair and she sat down behind
the fat-bellied German coffee-pot, which sent
out Its morning fragrance, mingled with the
smell of crisp toast and savoury bacon, In the
distance. With his long, nervous fingers he
picked up the morning paper from his own
chair and sat down.</p>
<p>Zulena, a small mahogany-coloured
creature, brought In the grapefruit.</p>
<p>They took up their spoons.</p>
<p>Out of the silence Brian spoke. Blandly.  ‘’My dear, you misunderstand me entirely. I
simply meant that I hope you’re not going to
let her pester you. She will, you know, if you
give her half a chance and she’s anything at all
like your description of her. Anyway, they always do. Besides,” he corrected, “the man, her
husband, didn’t call you a nigger. There’s a
difference, you know.”</p>
<p>“No, certainly he didn’t. Not actually.
He couldn’t, not very well, since he didn’t
know. But he would have. It amounts to the
same thing. And I’m sure it was just as unpleasant.”</p>
<p>“U-mm, I don’t know. But it seems to
me,” he pointed out, “that you, my dear, had
all the advantage. You knew what his opinion
of you was, while he — Well, ‘twas ever thus.
We know, always have. They don’t. Not quite.
It has, you will admit, it’s humorous side, and,
sometimes, its conveniences.”</p>
<p>She poured the coffee.</p>
<p>“I can’t see It. I’m going to write Clare.
Today, If I can find a minute. It’s a thing we
might as well settle definitely, and immediately.
Curious, isn’t it, that knowing, as she does, his
unqualified attitude, she still — “</p>
<p>Brian interrupted: “It’s always that
way. Never known it to fail. Remember Albert Hammond, how he used to be for ever
haunting Seventh Avenue, and Lenox Avenue,
and the dancing-places, until some ‘shine’ took
a shot at him for casting an eye towards his
‘sheba?’ They always come back. I’ve seen it
happen time and time again.”</p>
<p>‘’But why?” Irene wanted to know.
“Why?”</p>
<p>“If I knew that, I’d know w^hat race is.”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t you think that having
got the thing, or things, they were after, and at
such risk, they’d be satisfied? Or afraid?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Brian agreed, “you certainly
would think so. But, the fact remains, they
aren’t. Not satisfied, I mean. I think they’re
scared enough most of the time, when they give
way to the urge and slip back. Not scared
enough to stop them, though. Why, the good
God only knows.”
Irene leaned forward, speaking, she
was aware, with a vehemence absolutely unnecessary, but which she could not control.</p>
<p>“Well, Clare can just count me out.
I’ve no intention of being the link between her
and her poorer darker brethren. After that
scene in Chicago too! To calmly expect me — “
She stopped short, suddenly too wrathful for
words.</p>
<p>“Quite right. The only sensible thing to
do. Let her miss you. It’s an unhealthy business, the whole affair. Always is.”</p>
<p>Irene nodded. “More coffee,” she offered.</p>
<p>“Thanks, no.” He took up his paper
again, spreading it open with a little rattling
noise.</p>
<p>Zulena came In bringing more toast.
Brian took a slice and bit into it with that audible crunching sound that Irene disliked so intensely, and turned back to his paper.</p>
<p>She said: “It’s funny about ^passing.’
We disapprove of it and at the same time condone It. It excites our contempt and yet we
rather admire It. We shy away from it with
an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it.”</p>
<p>“Instinct of the race to survive and expand.”</p>
<p>“Rot ! Everything can’t be explained by
some general biological phrase.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely everything can. Look at
the so-called whites, who’ve left bastards all
over the known earth. Same thing in them. Instinct of the race to survive and expand.”</p>
<p>With that Irene didn’t at all agree, but
many arguments in the past had taught her the
futility of attempting to combat Brian on
ground where he was more nearly at home than
she. Ignoring his unqualified assertion, she slid
away from the subject entirely.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” she asked, “if you’ll have
time to run me down to the printing-office. It’s
on a Hundred and Sixteenth Street. I’ve got to
see about some handbills and some more tickets for the dance.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. How’s it going? Everything all set?”</p>
<p>“Ye-es. I guess so. The boxes are all
sold and nearly all the first batch of tickets.
And we expect to take in almost as much again
at the door. Then, there’s all that cake to sell.
It’s a terrible lot of work, though.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bet it is. Uplifting the brother’s
no easy job. I’m as busy as a cat with fleas, myself.” And over his face there came a shadow.
“Lord! how I hate sick people, and their stupid,
meddling families, and smelly, dirty rooms, and
climbing filthy steps In dark hallways.”</p>
<p>“Surely,” Irene began, fighting back the
fear and irritation that she felt, “surely — “</p>
<p>Her husband silenced her, saying
sharply: “Let’s not talk about it, please.” And
immediately, in his usual, slightly mocking tone
he asked: “Are you ready to go now? I haven’t
a great deal of time to wait.”</p>
<p>He got up. She followed him out Into
the hall without replying. He picked up his soft
brown hat from the small table and stood a
moment whirling it round on his long teacoloured fingers.</p>
<p>Irene, watching him, was thinking: “It
Isn’t fair, It isn’t fair.” After all these years to
Still blame her like this. Hadn’t his success
proved that she’d been right in insisting that he
stick to his profession right there in New York?
Couldn’t he see, even now, that it had been
best? Not for her, oh no, not for her — she had
never really considered herself — but for him
and the boys. Was she never to be free of it,
that fear which crouched, always, deep down
within her, stealing away the sense of security,
the feeling of permanence, from the life which
she had so admirably arranged for them all,
and desired so ardently to have remain as it
was? That strange, and to her fantastic, notion
of Brian’s of going off to Brazil, which, though
unmentioned, yet lived within him; how it
frightened her, and — yes, angered her I</p>
<p>“Well?” he asked lightly.</p>
<p>“I’ll just get my things. One minute,”
she promised and turned upstairs.</p>
<p>Her voice had been even and her step
was firm, but in her there was no slackening of
the agitation, of the alarms, which Brian’s expression of discontent had raised. He had never
spoken of his desire since that long-ago time of
Storm and strain, of hateful and nearly disastrous quarrelling, when she had so firmly opposed him, so sensibly pointed out its utter
impossibility and its probable consequences to
her and the boys, and had even hinted at a dissolution of their marriage in the event of his
persistence in his idea. No, there had been, in
all the years that they had lived together since
then, no other talk of It, no more than there
had been any other quarrelling or any other
threats. But because, so she insisted, the bond
of flesh and spirit between them was so strong,
she knew, had always known, that his dissatisfaction had continued, as had his dislike and
disgust for his profession and his country.</p>
<p>A feeling of uneasiness stole upon her
at the inconceivable suspicion that she might
have been wrong in her estimate of her husband’s character. But she squirmed away from
it. Impossible ! She couldn’t have been wrong.
Everything proved that she had been right.
More than right, if such a thing could be. And
all, she assured herself, because she understood
him so well, because she had, actually, a special
talent for understanding him. It was, as she
saw it, the one thing that had been the basis of
the success which she had made of a marriage
that had threatened to fail. She knew him as
well as he knew himself, or better.</p>
<p>Then why worry? The thing, this discontent which had exploded into words, would
surely die, flicker out, at last. True, she had in
the past often been tempted to believe that it
had died, only to become conscious, in some
instinctive, subtle way, that she had been merely
deceiving herself for a while and that it still
lived. But it would die. Of that she was certain.
She had only to direct and guide her man, to
keep him going in the right direction.</p>
<p>She put on her coat and adjusted her
hat.</p>
<p>Yes, it would die, as long ago she had
made up her mind that it should. But in the
meantime, while it was still living and still had
the power to flare up and alarm her, it would
have to be banked, smothered, and something
offered in Its stead. She would have to make
some plan, some decision, at once. She frowned,
for it annoyed her intensely. For, though temporary, it would be important and perhaps disturbing. Irene didn’t like changes, particularly
changes that affected the smooth routine of her
household. Well, it couldn’t be helped. Something would have to be done. And immediately.</p>
<p>She took up her purse and drawing on
her gloves, ran down the steps and out through
the door which Brian held open for her and
stepped into the waiting car.</p>
<p>“You know,” she said, settling herself
into the seat beside him, “I’m awfuly glad to
get this minute alone with you. It does seem
that we’re always so busy — I do hate that —
but what can we do? I’ve had something on my
mind for ever so long, something that needs
talking over and really serious consideration.”</p>
<p>The car’s engine rumbled as it moved
out from the kerb and into the scant traffic of
the street under Brian’s expert guidance.</p>
<p>She studied his profile.</p>
<p>They turned into Seventh Avenue. Then
he said: “Well, let’s have it. No time like the
present for the settling of weighty matters.”
“It’s about Junior. I wonder if he isn’t
going too fast in school? We do forget that
he’s not eleven yet. Surely it can’t be good for
him to — well, if he is, I mean. Going too fast,
you know. Of course, you know more about
these things than I do. You’re better able to
judge. That is, if you’ve noticed or thought
about it at all.”</p>
<p>“I do wish, Irene, you wouldn’t be for
ever fretting about those kids. They’re all
right. Perfectly all right. Good, strong, healthy
boys, especially Junior. Most especially
Junior.”</p>
<p>“We-11, I s’pose you’re right. You’re
expected to know about things like that, and
I’m sure you wouldn’t make a mistake about
your own boy.” (Now, why had she said that?)
‘’But that isn’t all. I’m terribly afraid he’s
picked up some queer ideas about things — some
things — from the older boys, you know.”</p>
<p>Her manner was consciously light. Apparently she was intent of the maze of traffic,
but she was still watching Brian’s face closely.
On it was a peculiar expression. Was it, could
It possibly be, a mixture of scorn and distaste?</p>
<p>‘’Queer Ideas?” he repeated. “D’you
mean Ideas about sex, Irene?”</p>
<p>“Ye-es. Not quite nice ones. Dreadful
jokes, and things like that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” he threw at her. For a
while there was silence between them. After a
moment he demanded bluntly: “Well, what of
it? If sex isn’t a joke, what Is It? And what Is
a joke?”</p>
<p>“As you please, Brian. He’s your son,
you know.” Her voice was clear, level, disapproving.</p>
<p>“Exactly! And you’re trying to make a
molly-coddle out of him. Well, just let me tell
you, I won’t have it. And you needn’t think
I’m going to let you change him to some nice
kindergarten kind of a school because he’s getting a little necessary education. I won’t! He’ll
stay right where he is. The sooner and the more
he learns about sex, the better for him. And
most certainly if he learns that it’s a grand
joke, the greatest in the world. It’ll keep him
from lots of disappointments later on.”
Irene didn’t answer.</p>
<p>They reached the printing-shop. She got
out, emphatically slamming the car’s door behind her. There was a piercing agony of misery
In her heart. She hadn’t Intended to behave
like this, but her extreme resentment at his attitude, the sense of having been wilfully misunderstood and reproved, drove her to fury.</p>
<p>Inside the shop, she stilled the trembling
of her lips and drove back her rising anger.
Her business transacted, she came back to the
car In a chastened mood. But against the armour of Brian’s stubborn silence she heard herself saying In a calm, metallic voice: “I don’t
believe I’ll go back just now. I’ve remembered
that I’ve got to do something about getting
something decent to wear. I haven’t a rag that’s
fit to be seen. I’ll take the bus downtown.”</p>
<p>Brian merely doffed his hat In that maddening polite way which so successfully curbed
and yet revealed his temper.</p>
<p>‘’Good-bye,” she said bitlngly. “Thanks
for the lift,” and turned towards the avenue.</p>
<p>What, she wondered contritely, was she
to do next? She was vexed with herself for
having chosen, as it had turned out, so clumsy
an opening for what she had intended to suggest: some European school for Junior next
year, and Brian to take him over. If she had
been able to present her plan, and he had accepted it, as she was sure that he would have
done, with other more favourable opening
methods, he would have had that to look forward to as a break in the easy monotony that
seemed, for some reason she was wholly unable to grasp, so hateful to him.</p>
<p>She was even more vexed at her own
explosion of anger. What could have got into
her to give way to it in such a moment?</p>
<p>Gradually her mood passed. She drew
back from the failure her first attempt at substitution, not so much discouraged as disappointed and ashamed. It might be, she reflected,
that, in addition to her ill-timed loss of temper,
she had been too hasty in her eagerness to distract him, had rushed too closely on the heels
of his outburst, and had thus aroused his suspicions and his obstinacy. She had but to wait.
Another more appropriate time would come,
tomorrow, next week, next month. It wasn’t
now, as It had been once, that she was afraid
that he would throw everything aside and rush
off to that remote place of his heart’s desire.
He wouldn’t, she knew. He was fond of her,
loved her, in his slightly undemonstrative way.</p>
<p>And there were the boys.</p>
<p>It was only that she wanted him to be
happy, resenting, however, his inability to be
so with things as they were, and never acknowledging that though she did want him to be
happy. It was only In her own way and by some
plan of hers for him that she truly desired him
to be so. Nor did she admit that all other plans,
all other ways, she regarded as menaces, more
or less Indirect, to that security of place and
substance which she Insisted upon for her sons
and in a lesser degree for herself.</p>
