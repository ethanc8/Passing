<h1>Three<a class="headerlink" href="#three" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The things which Irene Redfield remembered
afterward about the Negro Welfare League
dance seemed, to her, unimportant and unrelated.</p>
<p>She remembered the not quite derisive
smile with which Brian had cloaked his vexation when she informed him — oh, so apologetically— that she had promised to take Clare,
and related the conversation of her visit.</p>
<p>She remembered her ov/n little choked
exclamation of admiration, when, on coming
downstairs a few minutes later than she had
intended, she had rushed into the living-room
where Brian was waiting and had found Clare
there too. Clare, exquisite, golden, fragrant,
flaunting, in a stately gown of shining black
taffeta, whose long, full skirt lay in graceful
folds about her slim golden feet; her glistening hair drawn smoothly back into a small
twist at the nape of her neck; her eyes spar kllng like dark jewels. Irene, with her new rosecoloured chiffon frock ending at the knees, and
her cropped curls, felt dowdy and commonplace. She regretted that she hadn’t counselled
Clare to wear something ordinary and inconspicuous. What on earth would Brian think of
deliberate courting of attention? But if Clare
Kendry’s appearance had in it anything that
was, to Brian Redfield, annoying or displeasing,
the fact was not discernible to his wife as, with
an uneasy feeling of guilt, she stood there looking into his face while Clare explained that she
and he had made their own introductions, accompanying her words with a little deferential
smile for Brian, and receiving in return one of
his amused, slightly mocking smiles.</p>
<p>She remembered Clare’s saying, as they
sped northward: “You know, I feel exactly as
I used to on the Sunday we went to the Christmas-tree celebration. I knew there was to be a
surprise for me and couldn’t quite guess what
it was to be. I am so excited. You can’t possibly
imagine ! It’s marvellous to be really on the
way! I can hardly believe it!”</p>
<p>At her words and tone a chilly wave of
scorn had crept through Irene. All those superlatives ! She said, taking care to speak indifferently: “Well, maybe in some ways you will be
surprised, more, probably, than you anticipate.”</p>
<p>Brian, at the wheel, had thrown back:
“And then again, she won’t be so very surprised after all, for it’ll no doubt be about what
she expects. Like the Christmas-tree.”</p>
<p>She remembered rushing around here
and there, consulting with this person and that
one, and now and then snatching a part of a
dance with some man whose dancing she particularly liked.</p>
<p>She remembered catching glimpses of
Clare in the whirling crowd, dancing, sometimes with a white man, more often with a
Negro, frequently with Brian. Irene was glad
that he was being nice to Clare, and glad that
Clare was having the opportunity to discover
that some coloured men were superior to some
white men.</p>
<p>She remembered a conversation she had
with Hugh Wentworth in a free half-hour when
she had dropped into a chair in an emptied box
and let her gaze wander over the bright crowd
below.</p>
<p>Young men, old men, white men, black
men; youthful women, older women, pink
women, golden women; fat men, thin men, tall
men, short men; stout women, slim women,
stately women, small women moved by. An old
nursery rhyme popped into her head. She
turned to Wentworth, who had just taken a
seat beside her, and recited it:</p>
<p>‘’Rich man, poor man,
Beggar man,  thief,
Doctor, lawyer,
Indian chief.”</p>
<p>‘Tes,” Wentworth said, “that’s it.
Everybody seems to be here and a few more.
But what I’m trying to find out is the name,
status, and race of the blonde beauty out of the
fairy-tale. She’s dancing with Ralph Hazelton
at the moment. Nice study in contrasts, that.”</p>
<p>It was. Clare fair and golden, like a
sunlit day. Hazelton dark, with gleaming eyes,
like a moonlit night.
“She’s a girl I used to know a long
time ago In Chicago. And she wanted especially
to meet you.”</p>
<p>“ ‘S awfully good of her, Fm sure. And
now, alas ! the usual thing’s happened. All these
others, these — er — ‘gentlemen of colour’ have
driven a mere Nordic from her mind.”</p>
<p>‘’Stuff!”</p>
<p>“ ‘S a fact, and what happens to all the
ladles of my superior race who’re lured up
here. Look at Blanca. Have I laid eyes on her
tonight except In spots, here and there, being
twirled about by some Ethiopian? I have not.”</p>
<p>“But, Hugh, you’ve got to admit that
the average coloured man is a better dancer
than the average white man — that Is, If the
celebrities and ‘butter and egg’ men who find
their way up here are fair specimens of white
Terpslchorean art.”</p>
<p>“Not having tripped the light fantastic
with any of the males, I’m not In a position to
argue the point. But I don’t think It’s merely
that. ‘S something else, some other attraction.
They’re always raving about the good looks of
some Negro, preferably an unusually dark one.
Take Hazelton there, for example. Dozens of
women have declared him to be fascinatingly
handsome. How about you, Irene? Do you
think he’s — er — ravishingly beautiful?”</p>
<p>“I do not! And I don’t think the
others do either. Not honestly, I mean. I think
that what they feel Is — well, a kind of emotional excitement. You know, the sort of thing
you feel in the presence of something strange,
and even, perhaps, a bit repugnant to you;
something so different that it’s really at the
opposite end of the pole from all your accustomed notions of beauty.”</p>
<p>“Damned if I don’t think you’re halfway right!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I am. Completely. (Except,
of course, when it’s just patronizing kindness
on their part.) And I know coloured girls
who’ve experienced the same thing — the other
way round, naturally.”</p>
<p>“And the men? You don’t subscribe to
the general opinion about their reason for coming up here. Purely predatory. Or, do you?”
“N-no. More curious, I should say.”</p>
<p>Wentworth, whose eyes were a clouded
amber colour, had given her a long, searching
look that was really a stare. He said: “All
this is awfully interestin’, Irene. We’ve got to
havw. a long talk about it some time soon.
There’s your friend from Chicago, first time up
here and all that. A case in point.”</p>
<p>Irene’s smile had only just lifted the
corners of her painted lips. A match blazed in
Wentworth’s broad hands as he lighted her
cigarette and his own, and flickered out before
he asked: ‘’Or isn’t she?”</p>
<p>Her smile changed to a laugh. “Oh,
Hugh! You’re so clever. You usually know
everything. Even how to tell the sheep from
the goats. What do you think? Is she?”</p>
<p>He blew a long contemplative wreath
of smoke. “Damned if I know! I’ll be as sure
as anything that I’ve learned the trick. And
then In the next minute I’ll find I couldn’t pick
some of ‘em if my life depended on It.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t let that worry you. Nobody can. Not by looking.”
“Not by looking, eh? Meaning?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t explain. Not clearly.
There are ways. But they’re not definite or
tangible.”</p>
<p>“Feeling of kinship, or something like
that?”</p>
<p>“Good heavens, no ! Nobody has that,
except for their in-laws.”</p>
<p>“Right again 1 But go on about the sheep
and the goats.”</p>
<p>“Well, take my own experience with
Dorothy Thompkins. I’d met her four or five
times, in groups and crowds of people, before
I knew she wasn’t a Negro. One day I went to
an awful tea, terribly dicty. Dorothy was there.
We got talking. In less than five minutes, I
knew she was ‘fay.’ Not from anything she did
or said or anything In her appearance. Just —
just something. A thing that couldn’t be registered.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand what you mean.
Yet lots of people ‘pass’ all the time.”</p>
<p>“Not on our side, Hugh. It’s easy for
a Negro to ‘pass’ for white. But I don’t think
it would be so simple for a white person to
*pass’ for coloured.”</p>
<p>“Never thought of that.”</p>
<p>“No, you wouldn’t. Why should you?”</p>
<p>He regarded her critically through mists
of smoke. “Slippln’ me, Irene?”</p>
<p>She said soberly: “Not you, Hugh. I’m
too fond of you. And you’re too sincere.”</p>
<p>And she remembered that towards the
end of the dance Brian had come to her and
said: “I’ll drop you first and then run Clare
down.” And that he had been doubtful of her
discretion when she had explained to him that
he wouldn’t have to bother because she had
asked Bianca Wentworth to take her down
with them. Did she, he had asked, think It had
been wise to tell them about Clare?</p>
<p>“I told them nothing,” she said sharply,
for she was unbearably tired, “except that she
was at the Walsingham. It’s on their way. And,
really, I haven’t thought anything about the
wisdom of it, but now that I do, I’d say it’s
much better for them to take her than you.”</p>
<p>“As you please. She’s your friend, you  know/’ he had answered, with a disclaiming
shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>Except for these few unconnected things
the dance faded to a blurred memory, its outlines mingling with those of other dances of its
kind that she had attended in the past and
would attend in the future.</p>
