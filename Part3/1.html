<h1>One<a class="headerlink" href="#one" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>X HE YEAR was getting on towards its end.
October, November had gone. December had
come and brought with it a httle snow and then
a freeze and after that a thaw and some soft
pleasant days that had in them a feeling of
spring.</p>
<p>It wasn’t, this mild weather, a bit
Christmasy, Irene Redfield was thinking, as
she turned out of Seventh Avenue into her own
street. She didn’t like it to be warm and
springy when it should have been cold and
crisp, or grey and cloudy as if snow was about
to fall. The weather, like people, ought to enter into the spirit of the season. Here the holidays were almost upon them, and the streets
through which she had come were streaked
with rills of muddy water and the sun shone so
warmly that children had taken off their hats
and scarfs. It was all as soft, as like April, as
possible. The kind of weather for Easter. Certainly not for Christmas.
Though, she admitted, reluctantly, she
herself didn’t feel the proper Christmas spirit
this year, either. But that couldn’t be helped, it
seemed, any more than the weather. She was
weary and depressed. And for all her trying,
she couldn’t be free of that dull, indefinite
misery which with increasing tenaciousness had
laid hold of her. The morning’s aimless wandering through the teeming Harlem streets,
long after she had ordered the flowers which
had been her excuse for setting out, was but
another effort to tear herself loose from it.</p>
<p>She went up the cream stone steps, into
the house, and down to the kitchen. There were
to be people in to tea. But that, she found, after
a few words with Sadie and Zulena, need give
her no concern. She was thankful. She didn’t
want to be bothered. She went upstairs and
took off her things and got into bed.</p>
<p>She thought: “Bother those people
coming to tea!”</p>
<p>She thought: “If I could only be sure
that at bottom it’s just Brazil.”
She thought : “Whatever It is, if I only
knew what it was, I could manage it.”</p>
<p>Brian again. Unhappy, restless, withdrawn. And she, who had prided herself on
knowing his moods, their causes and their remedies, had found it first unthinkable, and then
intolerable, that this, so like and yet so unlike
those other spasmodic restlessnesses of his,
should be to her incomprehensible and elusive.</p>
<p>He was restless and he was not restless.
He was discontented, yet there were times
when she felt he was possessed of some intense
secret satisfaction, like a cat who had stolen the
cream. He was irritable with the boys, especially Junior, for Ted, who seemed to have an
uncanny knowledge of his father’s periods of
off moods, kept out of his way when possible.
They got on his nerves, drove him to violent
outbursts of temper, very different from his
usual gently sarcastic remarks that constituted
his idea of discipline for them. On the other
hand, with her he was more than customarily
considerate and abstemious. And It had been
weeks since she had felt the keen edge of his
irony.</p>
<p>He was Hke a man marking time, waiting. But what was he waiting for? It was extraordinary that, after all these years of accurate perception, she now lacked the talent to
discover what that appearance of waiting
meant. It was the knowledge that, for all her
watching, all her patient study, the reason for
his humour still eluded her which filled her
with foreboding dread. That guarded reserve
of his seemed to her unjust. Inconsiderate, and
alarming. It was as If he had stepped out beyond her reach into some section, strange and
walled, where she could not get at him.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, thinking what a
blessing it would be if she could get a little
sleep before the boys came in from school. She
couldn’t, of course, though she was so tired,
having had, of late, so many sleepless nights.
Nights filled with questionings and premonitions.</p>
<p>But she did sleep — several hours.</p>
<p>She wakened to find Brian standing at
her bedside looking down at her, an unfathomable expression in his eyes.</p>
<p>She said: “I must have dropped off to
sleep,” and watched a slender ghost of his old
amused smile pass over his face.</p>
<p>“It’s getting on to four,” he told her,
meaning, she knew, that she was going to be
late again.</p>
<p>She fought back the quick answer that
rose to her lips and said instead: “I’m getting
right up. It was good of you to think to call
me.” She sat up.</p>
<p>He bowed. “Always the attentive husband, you see.”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed. Thank goodness, everything’s ready.”</p>
<p>“Except you.  Oh,  and  Clare’s  down</p>
<p>stairs.”</p>
<p>“Clare ! What a nuisance ! I didn’t ask
her. Purposely.”</p>
<p>“I see. Might a mere man ask why? Or
is the reason so subtly feminine that it wouldn’t
be understood by him?”</p>
<p>A little of his smile had come back.
Irene, who was beginning to shake off some of
her depression under his famlHar banter, said,
almost gaily: “Not at all. It just happens that
this party happens to be for Hugh, and that
Hugh happens not to care a great deal for
Clare; therefore I, who happen to be giving
the party, didn’t happen to ask her. Nothing
could be simpler. Could it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s so simple that I can
easily see beyond your simple explanation and
surmise that Clare, probably, just never happened to pay Hugh the admiring attention that
he happens to consider no more than his just
due. Simplest thing in the world.”</p>
<p>Irene exclaimed in amazement: “Why,
I thought you liked Hugh ! You don’t, you
can’t, believe anything so idiotic!”</p>
<p>“Well, Hugh does think he’s God, you
know.”</p>
<p>“That,” Irene declared, getting out of
bed, “is absolutely not true. He thinks ever so
much better of himself than that, as you, who
know and have read him, ought to be able to
guess. If you remember what a low opinion he
has of God, you won’t make such a silly mistake.”</p>
<p>She went into the closet for her things
and, coming back, hung her frock over the back
of a chair and placed her shoes on the floor
beside it. Then she sat down before her
dressing-table.</p>
<p>Brian didn’t speak. He continued to
stand beside the bed, seeming to look at nothing in particular. Certainly not at her. True,
his gaze was on her, but in it there was some
quality that made her feel that at that moment
she was no more to him than a pane of glass
through which he stared. At what? She didn’t
know, couldn’t guess. And this made her uncomfortable. Piqued her.</p>
<p>She said: “It just happens that Hugh
prefers intelligent women.”</p>
<p>Plainly he was startled. “D’you mean
that you think Clare is stupid?” he asked, regarding her with lifted eyebrows, which emphasized the disbelief of his voice.</p>
<p>She wiped the cold cream from her face,
before she said: “No, I don’t. She isn’t stupid.
She’s intelligent enough In a purely feminine
way. Eighteenth-century France would have
been a marvellous setting for her, or the old
South if she hadn’t made the mistake of being
born a Negro.”</p>
<p>“I see. Intelligent enough to wear a
tight bodice and keep bowing swains whispering compliments and retrieving dropped fans.
Rather a pretty picture. I take it, though, as
slightly feline in Its Implication.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, all I can say is that you
take it wrongly. Nobody admires Clare more
than I do, for the kind of Intelligence she has,
as well as for her decorative qualities. But
she’s not — She isn’t — She hasn’t — Oh, I can’t
explain it. Take Bianca, for example, or, to
keep to the race, Felise Freeland. Looks and
brains. Real brains that can hold their own with
anybody. Clare has got brains of a sort, the
kind that are useful too. Acquisitive, you know.
But she’d bore a man like Hugh to suicide. Still,
I never thought that even Clare would come to
a private party to which she hadn’t been asked.
But, it’s like her.”</p>
<p>For a minute there was silence. She
completed the bright red arch of her full lips.
Brian moved towards the door. His hand was
on the knob. He said: “I’m sorry, Irene. It’s
my fault entirely. She seemed so hurt at being
left out that I told her I was sure you’d forgotten and to just come along.”</p>
<p>Irene cried out: “But, Brian, I — “ and
stopped, amazed at the fierce anger that had
blazed up In her.</p>
<p>Brian’s head came round with a jerk.
His brows lifted In an odd surprise.</p>
<p>Her voice, she realized, had gone queer.
But she had an Instinctive feeling that It hadn’t
been the whole cause of his attitude. And that
little straightening motion of the shoulders.
Hadn’t It been like that of a man drawing himself up to receive a blow? Her fright was like
a scarlet spear of terror leaping at her heart.</p>
<p>Clare Kendry! So that was It! Impossible. It couldn’t be.</p>
<p>In the mirror before her she saw that
he was still regarding her with that air of slight
amazement. She dropped her eyes to the jars
and bottles on the table and began to fumble
among them with hands whose fingers shook
slightly.</p>
<p>‘’Of course,” she said carefully, ‘Tm
glad you did. And in spite of my recent remarks, Clare does add to any party. She’s so
easy on the eyes.”</p>
<p>When she looked again, the surprise
had gone from his face and the expectancy
from, his bearing.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he agreed. “Well, I guess Til run
along. One of us ought to be down, I s’pose.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. One of us ought to.”
She was surprised that it was in her normal
tones she spoke, caught as she was by the heart
since that dull indefinite fear had grown suddenly into sharp panic. “I’ll be down before
you know it,” she promised.</p>
<p>“All right.” But he still lingered.
“You’re quite certain. You don’t mind my asking her? Not awfully, I mean? I see now that
I ought to have spoken to you. Trust women to
have their reasons for everything.”</p>
<p>She made a little pretence at looking at  him, managed a tiny smile, and turned away.
Clare! How sickening!</p>
<p>“Yes, don’t they?” she said, striving to
keep her voice casual. Within her she felt a
hardness from feeling, not absent, but repressed. And that hardness was rising, swelling. Why didn’t he go? Why didn’t he?</p>
<p>He had opened the door at last. “You
won’t be long?” he asked, admonished.</p>
<p>She shook her head, unable to speak,
for there was a choking in her throat, and the
confusion in her mind was like the beating of
wings. Behind her she heard the gentle Impact
of the door as it closed behind him, and knew
that he had gone. Down to Clare.</p>
<p>For a long minute she sat in strained
stiffness. The face in the mirror vanished from
her sight, blotted out by this thing which had
so suddenly flashed across her groping mind.
Impossible for her to put it immediately into
words or give it outline, for, prompted by some
impulse of self-protection, she recoiled from
exact expression.</p>
<p>She closed her unseeing eyes and  clenched her fists. She tried not to cry. But her
Hps tightened and no effort could check the hot
tears of rage and shame that sprang into her
eyes and flowed down her cheeks; so she laid
her face in her arms and wept silently.</p>
<p>When she was sure that she had done
crying, she wiped away the warm remaining
tears and got up. After bathing her swollen
face in cold, refreshing water and carefully
applying a stinging splash of toilet water, she
went back to the mirror and regarded herself
gravely. Satisfied that there lingered no betraying evidence of weeping, she dusted a little
powder on her dark-white face and again examined it carefully, and with a kind of ridiculing contempt.</p>
<p>“I do think,” she confided to it, “that
youVe been something — oh, very much — of a
damned fool.”</p>
<p>Downstairs the ritual of tea gave her
some busy moments, and that, she decided, was
a blessing. She wanted no empty spaces of time
in which her mind would immediately return to
that horror which she had not yet gathered suf ficient courage to face. Pouring tea properly
and nicely was an occupation that required a
kind of well-balanced attention.</p>
<p>In the room beyond, a clock chimed. A
single sound. Fifteen minutes past five o’clock.
That was all ! And yet in the short space of
half an hour all of life had changed, lost its
colour, Its vividness, its whole meaning. No,
she reflected, it wasn’t that that had happened.
Life about her, apparently, went on exactly as
before.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mrs. Runyon. … So nice to see
you… . Two? … Really? … How exciting! … Yes, I think Tuesday’s all
right… .”</p>
<p>Yes, life went on precisely as before.
It was only she that had changed. Knowing,
stumbling on this thing, had changed her. It
was as If In a house long dim, a match had been
struck, showing ghastly shapes where had been
only blurred shadows.</p>
<p>Chatter, chatter, chatter. Someone
asked her a question. She glanced up with what
she felt was a rigid smile.
“Yes … Brian picked it up last winter in Haiti. Terribly weird, isn’t it? … It
is rather marvellous in its own hideous way.
… Practically nothing, I believe. A few
cents… .”</p>
<p>Hideous. A great weariness came over
her. Even the small exertion of pouring golden
tea into thin old cups seemed almost too much
for her. She went on pouring. Made repetitions
of her smile. Answered questions. Manufactured conversation. She thought: “I feel like
the oldest person in the world with the longest
stretch of life before me.”</p>
<p>“Josephine Baker? … No. I’ve never
seen her… . Well, she might have been in
Shuffle Along when I saw it, but if she was, I
don’t remember her… . Oh, but you’re
wrong I … I do think Ethel Waters is awfully good. …”</p>
<p>There were the familiar little tinkling
sounds of spoons striking against frail cups, the
soft running sounds of inconsequential talk,
punctuated now and then with laughter. In irregular small groups,  disintegrating,  coalesc ing, striking just the right note of disharmony,
disorder in the big room, which Irene had furnished with a sparingness that was almost
chaste, moved the guests with that slight familiarity that makes a party a success. On the
floor and the walls the sinking sun threw long,
fantastic shadows.</p>
<p>So like many other tea-parties she had
had. So unlike any of those others. But she
mustn’t think yet. Time enough for that after.
All the time in the world. She had a second’s
flashing knowledge of what those words might
portend. Time with Brian. Time without him.
It was gone, leaving in its place an almost uncontrollable impulse to laugh, to scream, to hurl
things about. She wanted, suddenly, to shock
people, to hurt them, to make them notice her,
to be aware of her suffering.</p>
<p>‘’Hello, Dave… . Felise… . Really
your clothes are the despair of half the women
in Harlem… . How do you do it? …
Lovely, is it Worth or Lanvin? … Oh, a
mere Babani. …”</p>
<p>“Merely that,” Felise Freeland ac-  knowledged. “Come out of it, Irene, whatever
it is. You look like the second grave-digger/’</p>
<p>“Thanks, for the hint, Felise. I’m not
feeling quite up to par. The weather, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Buy yourself an expensive new frock,
child. It always helps. Any time this child gets
the blues, it means money out of Dave’s pocket.
How’re those boys of yours?”</p>
<p>The boys! For once she’d forgotten
them.</p>
<p>They were, she told Felise, very well.
Felise mumbled something about that being
awfully nice, and said she’d have to fly, because
for a wonder she saw Mrs. Bellew sitting by
herself, “and I’ve been trying to get her alone
all afternoon. I want her for a party. Isn’t she
stunning today?”</p>
<p>Clare was. Irene couldn’t remember
ever having seen her look better. She was wearing a superlatively simple cinnamon-brown
frock which brought out all her vivid beauty,
and a little golden bowl of a hat. Around
her neck hung a string of amber beads that
would  easily  have  made  six  or  eight  like
one  Irene  owned.  Yes,  she  was  stunning.</p>
<p>The ripple of talk flowed on. The fire
roared. The shadows stretched longer.</p>
<p>Across the room was Hugh. He wasn’t,
Irene hoped, being too bored. He seemed as he
always did, a bit aloof, a little amused, and
somewhat weary. And as usual he was hovering before the book-shelves. But he was not,
she noticed, looking at the book he had taken
down. Instead, his dull amber eyes were held
by something across the room. They were a
little scornful. Well, Hugh had never cared for
Clare Kendry. For a minute Irene hesitated,
then turned her head, though she knew what it
was that held Hugh’s gaze. Clare, who had
suddenly clouded all her days. Brian, the
father of Ted and Junior.</p>
<p>Clare’s ivory face was what It always
was, beautiful and caressing. Or maybe today a
little masked. Unrevealing. Unaltered and undisturbed by any emotion within or without.
Brian’s seemed to Irene to be pitiably bare. Or
was it too as it always was? That half-effaced
seeking look, did he always have that? Queer,
that now she didn’t know, couldn’t recall. Then
she saw him smile, and the smile made his face
all eager and shining. Impelled by some inner
urge of loyalty to herself, she glanced away.
But only for a moment. And when she turned
towards them again, she thought that the look
on his face was the most melancholy and yet
the most scoffing that she had ever seen upon it.</p>
<p>In the next quarter of an hour she promised herself to Bianca Wentworth in Sixtysecond Street, Jane Tenant at Seventh Avenue
and a Hundred and Fiftieth Street, and the
Dashields in Brooklyn for dinner all on the
same evening and at almost the same hour.</p>
<p>Oh well, what did it matter? She had
no thoughts at all now, and all she felt was a
great fatigue. Before her tired eyes Clare
Kendry was talking to Dave Freeland. Scraps
of their conversation, in Clare’s husky voice,
floated over to her: “… always admired you
… so much about you long ago … everybody says so … no one but you… .” And
more of the same. The man hung rapt on her
words, though he was the husband of Felise
Freeland, and the author of novels that revealed a man of perception and a devastating
irony. And he fell for such pish-posh ! And all
because Clare had a trick of sliding down ivory
lids over astonishing black eyes and then lifting them suddenly and turning on a caressing
smile. Men like Dave Freeland fell for it. And
Brian.</p>
<p>Her mental and physical languor receded. Brian. What did it mean? How would it
affect her and the boys? The boys! She had a
surge of relief. It ebbed, vanished. A feeling of
absolute unimportance followed. Actually, she
didn’t count. She was, to him, only the mother
of his sons. That was all. Alone she was nothing. Worse. An obstacle.</p>
<p>Rage boiled up in her.</p>
<p>There was a slight crash. On the floor
at her feet lay the shattered cup. Dark stains
dotted the bright rug. Spread. The chatter
stopped. Went on. Before her, Zulena gathered
up the white fragments.</p>
<p>As from a distance Hugh Wentworth’s
dipt voice came to her,  though he was, she
w^s aware, somehow miraculously at her side.
“Sorry,” he apologized. “Must have pushed
you. Clumsy of me. Don’t tell me it’s priceless
and irreplaceable.”</p>
<p>It hurt. Dear God! How the thing
hurt! But she couldn’t think of that now. Not
with Hugh sitting there mumbling apologies
and lies. The significance of his words, the
power of his discernment, stirred in her a sense
of caution. Her pride revolted. Damn Hugh!
Something would have to be done about him.
Now. She couldn’t, it seemed, help his knowing. It was too late for that. But she could and
would keep him from knowing that she knew.
She could, she would bear it. She’d have to.
There were the boys. Her whole body went
taut. In that second she saw that she could bear
anything, but only if no one knew that she had
anything to bear. It hurt. It frightened her, but
she could bear it.</p>
<p>She turned to Hugh. Shook her head.
Raised innocent dark eyes to his concerned pale
ones. “Oh, no,” she protested, “you didn’t push
me. Cross your heart, hope to die, and I’ll tell
you how it happened.”</p>
<p>‘’Done!”</p>
<p>“Did you notice that cup? Well, you’re
lucky. It was the ugliest thing that your ancestors, the charming Confederates ever owned.
I’ve forgotten how many thousands of years
ago It was that Brian’s great-great-grand-uncle
owned it. But It has, or had, a good old hoary
history. It was brought North by way of the
subway. Oh, all right ! Be English if you want
to and call It the underground. What I’m coming to is the fact that I’ve never figured out a
way of getting rid of It until about five minutes
ago. I had an inspiration. I had only to break
it, and I was rid of it for ever. So simple ! And
I’d never thought of it before.”</p>
<p>Hugh nodded and his frosty smile
spread over his features. Had she convinced
him?</p>
<p>“Still,” she went on with a little laugh
that didn’t, she was sure, sound the least bit
forced, ‘’I’m perfectly willing for you to take
the blame and admit that you pushed me at the
wrong moment. What are friends for, if not to
help bear our sins? Brian will certainly be told
that it was your fault.</p>
<p>“More tea, Clare? … I haven’t had
a minute with you… . Yes, it is a nice party.
… You’ll stay to dinner, I hope… . Oh,
too bad! … I’ll be alone with the boys… .
They’ll be sorry. Brian’s got a medical meeting,
or something… . Nice frock you’re wearing.
… Thanks… . Well, good-bye; see you
soon, I hope.”</p>
<p>The clock chimed. One. Two, Three.
Four. Five. Six. Was It, could it be, only a little
over an hour since she had come down to tea?
One little hour.</p>
<p>“Must you go? … Good-bye… .
Thank you so much. … So nice to see
you… . Yes, Wednesday… . My love to
Madge… . Sorry, but Fm filled up for
Tuesday… . Oh, really? … Yes… .
Good-bye.  … Good-bye… .”</p>
<p>It hurt. It hurt like hell. But It didn’t
matter, If no one knew. If everything could go
on as before. If the boys were safe.</p>
<p>It did hurt.</p>
<p>But it didn’t matter.</p>
