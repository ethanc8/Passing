<h1>Three<a class="headerlink" href="#three" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>As IF In answer to her wish, the very next day
Irene came face to face with Bellew.</p>
<p>She had gone downtown with Fellse
Freeland to shop. The day was an exceptionally
cold one, with a strong wind that had whipped
a dusky red into Felise’s smooth golden cheeks
and driven moisture Into Irene’s soft brown
eyes.</p>
<p>Clinging to each other, with heads bent
against the wind, they turned out of the Avenue into Fifty-seventh Street. A sudden bluster
flung them around the corner with unexpected
quickness and they collided with a man.</p>
<p>“Pardon,” Irene begged laughingly,
and looked up Into the face of Clare Kendry’s
husband.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Redfield!”</p>
<p>His hat came off. He held out his
hand, smiling genially.</p>
<p>But the smile faded at once. Surprise,  incredulity, and — was it understanding? —
passed over his features.</p>
<p>He had, Irene knew, become conscious
of Felise, golden, with curly black Negro hair,
whose arm was still linked in her own. She
was sure, now, of the understanding in his
face, as he looked at her again and then back at
Felise. And displeasure.</p>
<p>He didn’t, however, withdraw his outstretched hand. Not at once.</p>
<p>But Irene didn’t take it. Instinctively,
in the first glance of recognition, her face had
become a mask. Now she turned on him a
totally uncomprehending look, a bit questioning. Seeing that he still stood with hand outstretched, she gave him the cool appraising
stare which she reserved for mashers, and
drew Felise on.</p>
<p>Felise drawled: “Aha! Been ^passing,’
have you? Well, I’ve queered that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m afraid you have.”</p>
<p>“Why, Irene Redfield! You sound as if
you cared terribly. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“I do, but not for the reason you think.
I don’t believe I’ve ever gone native in my life
except for the sake of convenience, restaurants,
theatre tickets, and things like that. Never socially I mean, except once. You’ve just passed
the only person that I’ve ever met disguised as
a white woman.”</p>
<p>“Awfully sorry. Be sure your sin will
find you out and all that. Tell me about it.”</p>
<p>‘Td like to. It would amuse you. But I
can’t.”</p>
<p>Felise’s laughter was as languidly nonchalant as her cool voice. “Can it possible that
the honest Irene has — Oh, do look at that
coat! There. The red one. Isn’t it a dream?”</p>
<p>Irene was thinking: “I had my chance
and didn’t take It. I had only to speak and to
Introduce him to Felise with the casual remark
that he was Clare’s husband. Only that. Fool.
Fool.” That Instinctive loyalty to a race. Why
couldn’t she get free of It? Why should It Include Clare? Clare, who’d shown little enough
consideration for her, and hers. What she felt
was not so much resentment as a dull despair
because she could not change herself In this re spect, could not separate individuals from the
race, herself from Clare Kendry.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home, Felise. I’m so tired I
could drop.”</p>
<p>“Why, we haven’t done half the things
we planned.”</p>
<p>“I know, but it’s too cold to be running
all over town. But you stay down if you want</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll do that, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>And now another problem confronted
Irene. She must tell Clare of this meeting.
Warn her. But how? She hadn’t seen her for
days. Writing and telephoning were equally
unsafe. And even if it was possible to get in
touch with her, what good would it do? If Bellew hadn’t concluded that he’d made a mistake,
if he was certain of her Identity — and he was
nobody’s fool — telling Clare wouldn’t avert the
results of the encounter. Besides, it was too
late. Whatever was in store for Clare Kendry
had already overtaken her.</p>
<p>Irene was conscious of a feeling of relieved thankfulness at the thought that she
was probably rid of Clare, and without having
lifted a finger or uttered one word.</p>
<p>But she did mean to tell Brian about
meeting John Bellew.</p>
<p>But that, it seemed, was impossible.
Strange. Something held her back. Each time
she was on the verge of saying: “I ran into
Clare’s husband on the street downtown today. I’m sure he recognized me, and Felise was
with me,” she failed to speak. It sounded too
much like the warning she wanted it to be. Not
even in the presence of the boys at dinner could
she make the bare statement.</p>
<p>The evening dragged. At last she said
good-night and went upstairs, the words unsaid.</p>
<p>She thought: “Why didn’t I tell him?
Why didn’t I? If trouble comes from this, I’ll
never forgive myself. I’ll tell him when he
comes up.”</p>
<p>She took up a book, but she could not
read, so oppressed was she by a nameless foreboding.
What if Bellew should divorce Clare?
Could he? There was the Rhinelander case.
But in France, in Paris, such things were very
easy. If he divorced her — If Clare were free —
But of all the things that could happen, that
was the one she did not want. She must get her
mind away from that possibility. She must.</p>
<p>Then came a thought which she tried to</p>
<p>drive away. If Clare should die ! Then — Oh,</p>
<p>it was vile! To think, yes, to wish that! She</p>
<p>“  felt faint and sick. But the thought stayed with</p>
<p>her. She could not get rid of it.</p>
<p>She heard the outer door open. Close.
Brian had gone out. She turned her face into
her pillow to cry. But no tears came.</p>
<p>She lay there awake, thinking of things
past. Of her courtship and marriage and Junior’s birth. Of the time they had bought the ^
house in which they had lived so long and so
happily. Of the time Ted had passed his pneumonia crisis and they knew he would live. And
of other sweet painful memories that would
never come again.</p>
<p>Above everything else she had wanted,
had striven, to keep undisturbed the pleasant
routine of her life. And now Clare Kendry had
come into It, and with her the menace of Impermanence.</p>
<p>‘’Dear God,” she prayed, “make March
come quickly.”</p>
<p>By and by she slept.</p>
