<h1>Two<a class="headerlink" href="#two" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>But it did matter. It mattered more than
anything had ever mattered before.</p>
<p>What bitterness ! That the one fear, the
one uncertainty, that she had felt, Brian’s ache
to go somewhere else, should have dwindled to
a childish triviality ! And with It the quality of
the courage and resolution with which she had
met It. From the visions and dangers which she
now perceived she shrank away. For them she
had no remedy or courage. Desperately she
tried to shut out the knowledge from which
had risen this turmoil, which she had no power
to moderate or still, within her. And half succeeded.</p>
<p>For, she reasoned, what was there,
what had there been, to show that she was even
half correct In her tormenting notion? Nothing.
She had seen nothing, heard nothing. She had
no facts or proofs. She was only making herself
unutterably wretched by an unfounded suspl cion. It had been a case of looking for trouble
and finding it in good measure. Merely that.</p>
<p>With this self-assurance that she had no
real knowledge, she redoubled her efforts to
drive out of her mind the distressing thought of
faiths broken and trusts betrayed which every
mental vision of Clare, of Brian, brought with
them. She could not, she would not, go again
through the tearing agony that lay just behind
her.</p>
<p>She must, she told herself, be fair. In
all their married life she had had no slightest
cause to suspect her husband of any Infidelity,
of any serious flirtation even. If — and she
doubted it — he had had his hours of outside
erratic conduct, they were unknown to her.
Why begin now to assume them? And on nothing more concrete than an idea that had leapt
into her mind because he had told her that he
had invited a friend, a friend of hers, to a party
in his own house. And at a time when she had
been, it was likely, more asleep than awake.
How could she without anything done or said,
or left undone or unsaid, so easily believe him
guilty? How be so ready to renounce all confidence in the worth of their life together?</p>
<p>And if, perchance, there were some
small something — well, what could it mean?
Nothing. There were the boys. There was John
Bellew. The thought of these three gave her
some slight relief. But she did not look the future in the face. She wanted to feel nothing, to
think nothing; simply to believe that it was all
silly invention on her part. Yet she could not.
Not quite.</p>
<p>Christmas, with its unreality, Its hectic
rush. Its false gaiety, came and went. Irene was
thankful for the confused unrest of the season.
Its Irksomeness, Its crowds, Its Inane and Insincere repetitions of genialities, pushed between
her and the contemplation of her growing unhapplness.</p>
<p>She was thankful, too, for the continued
absence of Clare, who, John Bellew having returned from a long stay in Canada, had withdrawn to that other life of hers, remote and Inaccessible.  But  beating  against  the  walled
prison of Irene’s thoughts was the shunned
fancy that, though absent, Clare Kendry was
still present, that she was close.</p>
<p>Brian, too, had withdrawn. The house
contained his outward self and his belongings.
He came and went with his usual noiseless irregularity. He sat across from her at table.
He slept in his room next to hers at night. But
he was remote and inaccessible. No use pretending that he was happy, that things were
the same as they had always been. He wasn’t
and they weren’t. However, she assured herself, it needn’t necessarily be because of anything that involved Clare. It was, it must be,
another manifestation of the old longing.</p>
<p>But she did wish it were spring, March,
so that Clare would be sailing, out of her life
and Brian’s. Though she had come almost to
believe that there was nothing but generous
friendship between those two, she was very
tired of Clare Kendry. She wanted to be free
of her, and of her furtive comings and goings.
If something would only happen, something
that would make John  Bellew decide on an
earlier departure, or that would remove Clare.
Anything. She didn’t care what. Not even if it
were that Clare’s Margery were ill, or dying.
Not even if Bellew should discover—</p>
<p>She drew a quick, sharp breath. And for
a long time sat staring down at the hands in
her lap. Strange, she had not before realized
how easily she could put Clare out of her life !
She had only to tell John Bellew that his wife
— No. Not that! But if he should somehow
learn of these Harlem visits — Why should she
hesitate? Why spare Clare?</p>
<p>But she shrank away from the idea of
telling that man, Clare Kendry’s white husband,
anything that would lead him to suspect that
his wife was a Negro. Nor could she write it,
or telephone it, or tell it to someone else who
would tell him.</p>
<p>She was caught between two allegiances,
different, yet the same. Herself. Her race.
Race ! The thing that bound and suffocated her.
Whatever steps she took, or if she took none
at all, something would be crushed. A person
or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it
might be, all three. Nothing, she Imagined, was
ever more completely sardonic.</p>
<p>Sitting alone In the quiet living-room In
the pleasant fire-light, Irene Redfield wished,
for the first time In her life, that she had not
been born a Negro. For the first time she suffered and rebelled because she was unable to
disregard the burden of race. It was, she cried
silently, enough to suffer as a woman, an individual, on one’s own account, without having
to suffer for the race as well. It was a brutality,
and undeserved. Surely, no other people so
cursed as Ham’s dark children.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, her weakness, her shrinking, her own inability to compass the thing, did
not prevent her from wishing fervently that. In
some way with which she had no concern, John
Bellew would discover, not that his wife had a
touch of the tar-brush — Irene didn’t want that
— ^but that she was spending all the time that
he was out of the city In black Harlem. Only
that. It would be enough to rid her forever of
Clare Kendry.</p>
