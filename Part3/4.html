<p>X HE NEXT MORNING brought With it a snowstorm that lasted throughout the day.</p>
<p>After a breakfast, which had been eaten
almost in silence and which she was relieved to
have done with, Irene Redfield lingered for a
little while in the downstairs hall, looking out
at  the  soft  flakes  fluttering  down.  She  was
watching them immediately fill some ugly irregular gaps left by the feet of hurrying pedestrians when Zulena came to her, saying: “The
telephone, Mrs. Redfield. It’s Mrs. Bellew.”
“Take the message, Zulena, please.”
Though she continued to stare out of
the window, Irene saw nothing now, stabbed as
she  was  by  fear — and  hope.  Had  anything
happened between Clare and Bellew? And if
so, what? And was she to be freed at last from
the aching anxiety of the past weeks? Or was
there to be more, and worse? She had a wrestling moment, in which it seemed that she must
rush after Zulena and hear for herself what it
was that Clare had to say. But she waited.</p>
<p>Zulena, when she came back, said: “She
says, ma’am, that she’ll be able to go to Mrs.
Freeland’s tonight. She’ll be here some time between eight and nine.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Zulena.”</p>
<p>The day dragged on to its end.</p>
<p>At dinner Brian spoke bitterly of a
lynching that he had been reading about in the
evening paper.</p>
<p>“Dad, why is it that they only lynch
coloured people?” Ted asked.</p>
<p>“Because they hate ‘em, son.”</p>
<p>“Brian!” Irene’s voice was a plea and a
rebuke.</p>
<p>Ted said: “Oh! And why do they hate</p>
<p>em</p>
<p>“Because they are afraid of them.”
“But what makes them afraid of ‘em?”
“Because — “
“Brian!”</p>
<p>“It seems, son, that is a subject we can’t<br />
go into at the moment without distressing the
ladies of our family,” he told the boy with mock
seriousness, “but we’ll take it up some time
when we’re alone together.”</p>
<p>Ted nodded in his engaging grave way. “I
see. Maybe we can talk about it tomorrow on
the way to school.”</p>
<p>‘That’ll be line.”</p>
<p>“Brian!”</p>
<p>“Mother,” Junior remarked, “that’s
the third time you’ve said ‘Brian’ like that.”</p>
<p>“But not the last. Junior, never you
fear,” his father told him.</p>
<p>After the boys had gone up to their own
floor, Irene said suavely: “I do wish, Brian,
that you wouldn’t talk about lynching before
Ted and Junior. It was really inexcusable for
you to bring up a thing like that at dinner.
There’ll be time enough for them to learn
about such horrible things when they’re older.”</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely wrong! If, as you’re
so determined, they’ve got to live in this
damned country, they’d better find out what
sort of thing they’re up against as soon as possible. The earlier they learn it, the better prepared they’ll be.”</p>
<p>“I don’t agree. I want their childhood
to be happy and as free from the knowledge of
such things as It possibly can be.”</p>
<p>“Very laudable,” was Brian’s sarcastic
answer. “Very laudable indeed, all things considered. But can it?”</p>
<p>“Certainly It can. If you’ll only do your
part.”</p>
<p>“Stuff ! You know as well as I do, Irene,
that It can’t. What was the use of our trying
to keep them from learning the word ‘nigger’
and its connotation? They found out, didn’t
they? And how? Because somebody called Junior a dirty nigger.”</p>
<p>“Just the same you’re not to talk to
them about the race problem. I won’t have It.”</p>
<p>They glared at each other.</p>
<p>“I tell you, Irene, they’ve got to know
these things, and it might as well be now as
later.”</p>
<p>“They do not!” she insisted, forcing  back the tears of anger that were threatening
to fall.</p>
<p>Brian growled : “I can’t understand how
anybody as intelligent as you like to think you
are can show evidences of such stupidity.” He
looked at her in a puzzled harassed way.</p>
<p>“Stupid!” she cried. “Is it stupid to
want my children to be happy?” Her lips were
quivering.</p>
<p>“At the expense of proper preparation
for life and their future happiness, yes. And Td
feel I hadn’t done my duty by them if I didn’t
give them some inkling of what’s before them.
It’s the least I can do. I wanted to get them
out of this hellish place years ago. You
wouldn’t let me. I gave up the idea, because you
objected. Don’t expect me to give up everything.”</p>
<p>Under the lash of his words she was
silent. Before any answer came to her, he had
turned and gone from the room.</p>
<p>Sitting there alone in the forsaken
dining-room, unconsciously pressing the hands
lying in her lap, tightly together, she was seized
by a convulsion of shivering. For, to her, there
had been something ominous in the scene that
she had just had with her husband. Over and
over in her mind his last words: “Don’t expect
me to give up everything,” repeated themselves.
What had they meant? What could they mean?
Clare Kendry?</p>
<p>Surely, she was going mad with fear
and suspicion. She must not work herself up.
She must not ! Where were all the self-control,
the common sense, that she was so proud of?
Now, if ever, was the time for it.</p>
<p>Clare would soon be there. She must
hurry or she would be late again, and those two
would wait for her downstairs together, as they
had done so often since that first time, which
now seemed so long ago. Had it been really
only last October? Why, she felt years, not
months, older.</p>
<p>Drearily she rose from her chair and
went upstairs to set about the business of dressing to go out when she would far rather have
remained at home. During the process she wondered, for the hundredth time, why she hadn’t
told Brian about herself and Fellse running
into Bellew the day before, and for the hundredth time she turned away from acknowledging to herself the real reason for keeping back
the information.</p>
<p>When Clare arrived, radiant in a shining red gown, Irene had not finished dressing.
But her smile scarcely hesitated as she greeted
her, saying: ‘’I always seem to keep C. P. time,
don’t I? We hardly expected you to be able to
come. Felise will be pleased. How nice you
look.’’</p>
<p>Clare kissed a bare shoulder, seeming
not to notice a slight shrinking.</p>
<p>“I hadn’t an idea in the world, myself,
that I’d be able to make it; but Jack had to
run down to Philadelphia unexpectedly. So here
I am.”</p>
<p>Irene looked up, a flood of speech on
her lips. “Philadelphia. That’s not very far, is
it? Clare, I—?”</p>
<p>She stopped, one of her hands clutching the side of her stool, the other lying
clenched on the dressing-table. Why didn’t she
go on and tell Clare about meeting Bellew?
Why couldn’t she?</p>
<p>But Clare didn’t notice the unfinished
sentence. She laughed and said lightly: “It’s far
enough for me. Anywhere, away from me, is
far enough. I’m not particular.”</p>
<p>Irene passed a hand over her eyes to
shut out the accusing face in the glass before
her. With one corner of her mind she wondered
how long she had looked like that, drawn and
haggard and — yes, frightened. Or was it only
Imagination?</p>
<p>“Clare,” she asked, “have you ever seriously thought what It would mean If he should
find you out?”
,    “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh! You have! And what you’d do In
that case?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” And having said it, Clare Kendry smiled quickly, a smile that came and went
like a flash, leaving untouched the gravity of
her face.</p>
<p>That smile and the quiet resolution of  that one word, ‘’yes,” filled Irene with a
primitive paralysing dread. Her hands were
numb, her feet like ice, her heart like a stone
weight. Even her tongue was like a heavy
dying thing. There were long spaces between
the words as she asked: “And what should
you do?”</p>
<p>Clare, who was sunk in a deep chair, her
eyes far away, seemed wrapped in some pleasant impenetrable reflection. To Irene, sitting expectantly upright, it was an interminable time
before she dragged herself back to the present
to say calmly: ‘Td do what I want to do more
than anything else right now. I’d come up here
to live. Harlem, I mean. Then I’d be able to do
as I please, when I please.”</p>
<p>Irene leaned forward, cold and tense.
‘’And what about Margery?” Her voice was a
strained whisper.</p>
<p>“Margery?” Clare repeated, letting her
eyes flutter over Irene’s concerned face. “Just
this, ‘Rene. If It wasn’t for her, I’d do it anyway. She’s all that holds me back. But if Jack
finds out, if our marriage is broken, that lets
me out. Doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Her gentle resigned tone, her air of innocent candour, appeared, to her listener, spurious. A conviction that the words were intended
as a warning took possession of Irene. She remembered that Clare Kendry had always
seemed to know what other people were thinking. Her compressed lips grew firm and obdurate. Well, she wouldn’t know this time.</p>
<p>She said: “Do go downstairs and talk
to Brian. He’s got a mad on.”</p>
<p>Though she had determined that Clare
should not get at her thoughts and fears, the
words had sprung, unthought of, to her lips. It
was as if they had come from some outer layer
of callousness that had no relation to her tortured heart. And they had been, she realized,
precisely the right words for her purpose.</p>
<p>For as Clare got up and went out, she
saw that that arrangement was as good as her
first plan of keeping her waiting up there while
she dressed — or better. She would only have
hindered and rasped her. And what matter if
those two spent one hour, more or less, alone
together, one or many, now that everything had
happened between them?</p>
<p>Ah ! The first time that she had allowed
herself to admit to herself that everything had
happened, had not forced herself to believe, to
hope, that nothing irrevocable had been consummated ! Well, it had happened. She knew it,
and knew that she knew it.</p>
<p>She was surprised that, having thought
the thought, conceded the fact, she was no
more hurt, cared no more, than during her previous frenzied endeavours to escape it. And this
absence of acute, unbearable pain seemed to her
unjust, as If she had been denied some exquisite
solace of suffering which the full acknowledgment should have given her.</p>
<p>Was it, perhaps, that she had endured
all that a woman could endure of tormenting
humiliation and fear? Or was it that she
lacked the capacity for the acme of suffering?
“No,  no!”  she  denied  fiercely.  “I’m  human
like everybody else. It’s just that rm so tired,
so worn out, I can’t feel any more.” But she
did not really believe that.</p>
<p>Security. Was It just a word? If not,
then was It only by the sacrifice of other things,
happiness, love, or some wild ecstasy that she
had never known, that It could be obtained?
And did too much striving, too much faith In
safety and permanence, unfit one for these
other things?</p>
<p>Irene didn’t know, couldn’t decide,
though for a long time she sat questioning and
trying to understand. Yet all the while. In spite
of her searchlngs and feeling of frustration,
she was aware that, to her, security was the
most Important and desired thing In life. Not
for any of the others, or for all of them,
would she exchange it. She wanted only to be
tranquil. Only, unmolested, to be allowed to
direct for their own best good the lives of her
sons and her husband.</p>
<p>Now that she had relieved herself of
what was almost like a guilty knowledge, admitted that which by some sixth sense she had
long known, she could again reach out for
plans. Could think again of ways to keep Brian
by her side, and in New York. For she would
not go to Brazil. She belonged In this land of
rising towers. She was an American. She grew
from this soil, and she would not be uprooted.
Not even because of Clare Kendry, or a hundred Clare Kendrys.</p>
<p>Brian, too, belonged here. His duty was
to her and to his boys.</p>
<p>Strange, that she couldn’t now be sure
that she had ever truly known love. Not even
for Brian. He was her husband and the father
of her sons. But was he anything more? Had
she ever wanted or tried for more ? In that hour
she thought not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she meant to keep him.
Her freshly painted lips narrowed to a thin
straight line. True, she had left off trying to
believe that he and Clare loved and yet did not
love, but she still intended to hold fast to the
outer shell of her marriage, to keep her life
fixed, certain. Brought to the edge of distasteful reality, her fastidious nature did not recoil.
Better, far better, to share him than to lose him
completely. Oh, she could close her eyes, if
need be. She could bear it. She could bear anything. And there was March ahead. March
and the departure of Clare.</p>
<p>Horribly clear, she could now see the
reason for her instinct to withhold — omit,
rather — her news of the encounter with Bellew.
If Clare was freed, anything might happen.</p>
<p>She paused in her dressing, seeing with
perfect clearness that dark truth which she had
from that first October afternoon felt about
Clare Kendry and of which Clare herself had
once warned her — that she got the things she
wanted because she met the great condition of
conquest, sacrifice. If she wanted Brian, Clare
wouldn’t revolt from the lack of money or
place. It was as she had said, only Margery
kept her from throwing all that away. And if
things were taken out of her hands — Even if
she was only alarmed, only suspected that such
a thing was about to occur, anything might
happen. Anything.</p>
<p>No ! At all costs, Clare was not to know  of that meeting with Bellew. Nor was Brian.
It would only weaken her own power to keep
him.</p>
<p>They would never know from her that
he was on his way to suspecting the truth about
his wife. And she would do anything, risk anything, to prevent him from finding out that
truth. How fortunate that she had obeyed her
Instinct and omitted to recognize Bellew !</p>
<p>“Ever go up to the sixth floor, Clare?”
Brian asked as he stopped the car and got out
to open the door for them.</p>
<p>“Why, of course ! We’re on the seventeenth.”</p>
<p>“I mean, did you ever go up by niggerpower?”</p>
<p>‘That’s good!” Clare laughed. “Ask
‘Rene. My father was a janitor, you know. In
the good old days before every ramshackle flat
had Its elevator. But you can’t mean we’ve got
to walk up ? Not here!”</p>
<p>“Yes, here. And Fellse lives at the very
top,” Irene told her.
“What on earth for?’’</p>
<p>“I beheve she claims it discourages the
casual visitor.”</p>
<p>“And she’s probably right. Hard on
herself, though.”</p>
<p>Brian said “Yes, a bit. But she says
she’d rather be dead than bored.”</p>
<p>“Oh, a garden! And how lovely with
that undisturbed snow I”</p>
<p>“Yes, Isn’t It? But keep to the walk with
those foolish thin shoes. You too, Irene.”</p>
<p>Irene walked beside them on the cleared
cement path that split the whiteness of the
courtyard garden. She felt a something In the
air, something that had been between those
two and would be again. It was like a live thing
pressing against her. In a quick furtive glance
she saw Clare clinging to Brian’s other arm.
She was looking at him with that provocative
upward glance of hers, and his eyes were fastened on her face with what seemed to Irene
an expression of wistful eagerness.</p>
<p>“It’s this entrance, I believe,” she Informed them in quite her ordinary voice.
‘’Mind,” Brian told Clare, “you don’t
fall by the wayside before the fourth floor.
They absolutely refuse to carry anyone up more
than the last two flights.”</p>
<p>‘’Don’t be silly!” Irene snapped.</p>
<p>The party began gaily.</p>
<p>Dave Freeland was at his best, brilliant,
crystal clear, and sparkling. Felise, too, was
amusing, and not so sarcastic as usual, because
she liked the dozen or so guests that dotted
the long, untidy living-room. Brian was witty,
though, Irene noted, his remarks were somewhat more barbed than was customary even
with him. And there was Ralph Hazelton,
throwing nonsensical shining things into the
pool of talk, which the others, even Clare,
picked up and flung back with fresh adornment.</p>
<p>Only Irene wasn’t merry. She sat almost
silent, smiling now and then, that she might
appear amused.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Irene?” someone
asked. “Taken a vow never to laugh, or something? You’re as sober as a judge.”</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“No. It’s simply that the rest of you are
so clever that I’m speechless, absolutely
stunned.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“No wonder,” Dave Freeland remarked, “that you’re on the verge of tears. You
haven’t a drink. What’ll you take?”</p>
<p>“Thanks. If I must take something,
make It a glass of ginger-ale and three drops of
Scotch. The Scotch first, please. Then the ice,
then the ginger ale.”</p>
<p>“Heavens! Don’t attempt to mix that
yourself, Dave darling. Have the butler in,”
Fellse mocked.</p>
<p>“Yes, do. And the footman.” Irene
laughed a little, then said: “It seems dreadfully warm in here. Mind if I open this window?” With that she pushed open one of the
long casement-windows of which the Freelands
were so proud.</p>
<p>It had stopped snowing some two or
three hours back. The moon was just rising, and
far behind the tall buildings a few stars were
creeping out. Irene finished her cigarette and
threw It out, watching the tiny spark drop
slowly down to the white ground below.</p>
<p>Someone in the room had turned on the
phonograph. Or was it the radio? She didn’t
know which she disliked more. And nobody was
listening to its blare. The talking, the laughter
never for a minute ceased. Why must they have
more noise?</p>
<p>Dave came with her drink. “You ought
not,” he told her, “to stand there like that.
You’ll take cold. Come along and talk to me, or
listen to me gabble.” Taking her arm, he led
her across the room. They had just found seats
when the door-bell rang and Felise called over
to him to go and answer it.</p>
<p>In the next moment Irene heard his
voice in the hall, carelessly polite: “Your wife?
Sorry. I’m afraid you’re wrong. Perhaps
next — “</p>
<p>Then the roar of John Bellew’s voice
above all the other noises of the room: “I’m
not wrong! I’ve been to the Redfields and I
know she’s with them. You’d better stand out
of my way and save yourself trouble in the
end.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Dave?” Felise ran out to
the door.</p>
<p>And so did Brian. Irene heard him saying: “I’m Redfield. What the devil’s the matter
with you?”</p>
<p>But Bellew didn’t heed him. He pushed
past them all into the room and strode towards
Clare. They all looked at her as she got up
from her chair, backing a little from his approach.</p>
<p>“So you’re a nigger, a damned dirty
nigger!” His voice was a snarl and a moan, an
expression of rage and of pain.</p>
<p>Everything was in confusion. The men had
sprung forward. Felise had leapt between them
and Bellew. She said quickly: “Careful. You’re
the only white man here.” And the silver chill
of her voice, as well as her words, was a warning.</p>
<p>Clare stood at the window, as composed
as if everyone were not staring at her in curiosity and wonder, as if the whole structure of
her life were not lying In fragments before her.
She seemed unaware of any danger or uncaring.
There was even a faint smile on her full, red
lips, and in her shining eyes.</p>
<p>It was that smile that maddened Irene.
She ran across the room, her terror tinged with
ferocity, and laid a hand on Clare’s bare arm.
One thought possessed her. She couldn’t have
Clare Kendry cast aside by Bellew. She couldn’t
have her free.</p>
<p>Before them stood John Bellew, speechless now in his hurt and anger. Beyond them
the little huddle of other people, and Brian
stepping out from among them.</p>
<p>What happened next, Irene Redfield
never afterwards allowed herself to remember.
Never clearly.</p>
<p>One moment Clare had been there, a
vital glowing thing, like a flame of red and
gold. The next she was gone.</p>
<p>There was a gasp of horror, and above
it a sound not quite human, like a beast In
agony. “Nig! My God! Nig!”</p>
<p>A frenzied rush of feet down long  flights of stairs. The slamming of distant doors.
Voices.</p>
<p>Irene stayed behind. She sat down and
remained quite still, staring at a ridiculous
Japanese print on the wall across the room.</p>
<p>Gone ! The soft white face, the bright
hair, the disturbing scarlet mouth, the dreaming eyes, the caressing smile, the whole torturing loveliness that had been Clare Kendry. That
beauty that had torn at Irene’s placid Hfe.
Gone! The mocking daring, the gallantry of
her pose, the ringing bells of her laughter.</p>
<p>Irene wasn’t sorry. She was amazed, incredulous almost.</p>
<p>What would the others think? That
Clare had fallen? That she had deliberately
leaned backward? Certainly one or the other.
Not—</p>
<p>But she mustn’t, she warned herself,
think of that. She was too tired, and too
shocked. And, indeed, both were true. She was
utterly weary, and she was violently staggered.
But her thoughts reeled on. If only she could
be  as  free  of mental as she was  of bodily
vigour; could only put from her memory the
vision of her hand on Clare’s arm !</p>
<p>“It was an accident, a terrible accident,”
she muttered fiercely. “It wasT</p>
<p>People were coming up the stairs.
Through the still open door their steps and
talk sounded nearer, nearer.</p>
<p>Quickly she stood up and went noiselessly into the bedroom and closed the door
softly behind her.</p>
<p>Her thoughts raced. Ought she to have
stayed? Should she go back out there to them?
But there would be questions. She hadn’t
thought of them, of afterwards, of this. She
had thought of nothing in that sudden moment
of action.</p>
<p>It was cold. Icy chills ran up her spine
and over her bare neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>In the room outside there were voices.
Dave Freeland’s and others that she did not
recognize.</p>
<p>Should she put on her coat? Felise had
rushed down without any wrap. So had all the
others. So had Brian. Brian! He mustn’t take
cold. She took up his coat and left her own. At
the door she paused for a moment, listening
fearfully. She heard nothing. No voices. No
footsteps. Very slowly she opened the door.
The room was empty. She went out.</p>
<p>In the hall below she heard dimly the
sound of feet going down the steps, of a door
being opened and closed, and of voices far
away.</p>
<p>Down, down, down, she went, Brian’s
great coat clutched in her shivering arms and
trailing a little on each step behind her.</p>
<p>What was she to say to them when at
last she had finished going down those endless
stairs? She should have rushed out when they
did. What reason could she give for her dallying behind? Even she didn’t know why she had
done that. And what else would she be asked?
There had been her hand reaching out towards
Clare. What about that?</p>
<p>In the midst of her wonderings and
questionings came a thought so terrifying, so
horrible, that she had had to grasp hold of the
banister to save herself from pitching down wards. A cold perspiration drenched her shaking body. Her breath caipe short in sharp and
painful gasps.</p>
<p>What if Clare was not dead?</p>
<p>She felt nauseated, as much at the idea
of the glorious body mutilated as from fear.</p>
<p>How she managed to make the rest of
the journey without fainting she never knew.
But at last she was down. Just at the bottom
she came on the others, surrounded by a little
circle of strangers. They were all speaking in
whispers, or in the awed, discreetly lowered
tones adapted to the presence of disaster. In
the first instant she wanted to turn and rush
back up the way she had come. Then a calm
desperation came over her. She braced herself,
physically and mentally.</p>
<p>“Here’s Irene now,” Dave Freeland
announced, and told her that, having only just
missed her, they had concluded that she had
fainted or something like that, and were on the
way to find out about her. Felise, she saw, was
holding on to his arm, all the insolent nonchalance gone out of her, and the golden brown
of her handsome face changed to a queer mauve
colour.</p>
<p>Irene made no Indication that she had
heard Freeland, but went straight to Brian. His
face looked aged and altered, and his lips were
purple and trembling. She had a great longing
to comfort him, to charm away his suffering
and horror. But she was helpless, having
so completely lost control of his mind and
heart.</p>
<p>She stammered: “Is she — is she — ?”</p>
<p>It was Felise who answered. “Instantly,
we think.”</p>
<p>f^ Irene struggled against the sob of
[thankfulness that rose in her throat. Choked
down, it turned to a whimper, like a hurt
child’s. Someone laid a hand on her shoulder in
a soothing gesture. Brian wrapped his coat
about her. She began to cry rackingly, her entire body heaving with convulsive sobs. He
made a slight perfunctory attempt to comfort
her.</p>
<p>“There,  there,  Irene.  You  mustn’t.  You’ll make yourself sick. She’s — “ His voice
broke suddenly.</p>
<p>As from a long distance she heard
Ralph Hazelton’s voice saying: “I was looking right at her. She just tumbled over and was
gone before you could say ‘Jack Robinson.’
Fainted, I guess. Lord! It was quick. Quickest
thing I ever saw in all my life.”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible, I tell you I Absolutely
impossible!”</p>
<p>It was Brian who spoke in that frenzied
hoarse voice, which Irene had never heard before. Her knees quaked under her.</p>
<p>Dave Freeland said: “J^st a minute,
Brian. Irene was there beside her. Let’s hear
what she has to say.”</p>
<p>She had a moment of stark craven fear.
“Oh God,” she thought, prayed, “help me.”</p>
<p>A strange man, official and authoritative, addressed her. “You’re sure she fell? Her
husband didn’t give her a shove or anything
like that, as Dr. Redfield seems to think?”</p>
<p>For the first time she was aware that  Bellew was not in the little group shivering In
the small hallway. What did that mean? As she
began to work it out in her numbed mind, she
was shaken with another hideous trembling.
Not that! Oh, not that!</p>
<p>“No, no!” she protested. ^Tm quite
certain that he didn’t. I was there, too. As close
as he was. She just fell, before anybody could
stop her. I — “</p>
<p>Her quaking knees gave way under her.
She moaned and sank down, moaned again.
Through the great heaviness that submerged
and drowned her she was dimly conscious of
strong arms lifting her up. Then everything
was dark.</p>
<p>Centuries after, she heard the strange
man saying: ‘JDeath by misadventure, I’m Inclined to believe. Let’s go up and have another
look at that window.”</p>
